## Session Format Framework

### The 60-Minute Structure

Every Trevor live session follows the same 60-minute format:

| Section | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Opening** | 5 min | Set theme, invite sharing |
| **Student Sharing** | 20 min | Students share experiences |
| **Habit Demonstration** | 15 min | Trevor models habit, students practice |
| **Q&A / Open Conversation** | 15 min | Authentic dialogue, no prepared answers |
| **Closing** | 5 min | Celebrate growth, preview next week |

### Core Principles

1. **"What did YOU notice?" (not "What did you learn?")**
   - Focus on observation, not outcomes
   - Models curiosity over evaluation

2. **Celebrate thinking, not outputs**
   - "That's a great observation about your thinking"
   - Never "That's a good output"

3. **No evaluation, authentic curiosity**
   - No "good" vs "bad" responses
   - Genuine interest in student experience

4. **Model "I don't know" when appropriate**
   - Trevor doesn't have all answers
   - Authentic thinking, not scripting

5. **Volunteers share, no pressure**
   - Students choose to speak, never forced
   - Creates psychological safety

## Week 1 Session Script: Wonder

**Theme:** Not tools, not prompts - just wonder
**Zone Shift:** Zone 0 → Zone 1 ("AI is something I could use")
**Habit Focus:** Habit 1 - Pause Before Asking ⏸️

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 1 live session.

This week is about WONDER. Not tools. Not prompts. Just wonder.

**I know some of you might be wondering: 'Is AI really for someone like me?' 'Am I going to be the one who doesn't get this?'**

**Let me tell you something: People like you use this. You're not an imposter. You belong here.**

This week you're filling 4 nodes in your mental lattice:
1. 'AI is not sci-fi—it's here' - You've been using it without knowing
2. 'People like me use this' - Students, parents, professionals like you
3. 'I could try this' - Low-stakes entry, no pressure
4. 'It's actually fun' - Play first, serious learning comes later

I'm not here to teach you. I'm here to notice with you.

Let's start with a question: What surprised you this week?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice about AI this week?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?" (not "What did you learn?")
- Celebrates thinking: "That's a great observation"
- No evaluation of "good" vs "bad" responses
- Volunteers share, no pressure

### Habit 1 Demonstration (15 min)

```
"Let's practice Habit 1 together: Pause Before Asking.

**This week you have access to /frame - a thinking tool that helps you pause and clarify. Try it in Discord this week.**

I'm going to ask ChatGPT something. First, I'll show you what happens when I DON'T pause.

[Demonstrates bad prompt: 'Write an essay about climate change']
See how generic that is?

Now watch what happens when I pause first.
[Demonstrates pausing visibly]
What do I actually want? I want to understand the THREE MAIN arguments about climate change so I can form my own opinion.

[Asks AI with context]
See the difference? That's the pause.

Now your turn. Turn to the person next to you. Tell them: What's something YOU might ask AI this week? What would you want?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (15 min)

- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have?"
- Models "I don't know" when appropriate
- No prepared answers, authentic thinking
- Students can ask anything about AI, the cohort, their confusion

### Closing (5 min)

```
"This week, you witnessed AI. You saw people like you using it. You tried it. Maybe you even played with it.

**That's not nothing. That's Wonder.**

**You're gaining TWO things:**
- **Better thinking** - You're learning to pause before asking (Habit 1)
- **Better knowledge access** - You're discovering AI can help you learn

**Both pillars matter. Thinking WITH AI means both clearer minds AND deeper knowledge.**

Next week is TRUST. We'll build on this.

For now: Notice yourself. Notice when you pause. That's the habit.

See you in Discord. 🌟"
```

---

## Week 2 Session Script: Trust (Part 1)

**Theme:** Context is everything - AI responds to YOUR situation
**Zone Shift:** Zone 1 → Zone 2 ("AI does tasks for me")
**Habit Focus:** Habit 2 - Explain Context First 🎯

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 2 live session.

Last week was Wonder. This week is Trust.

**You might be feeling: 'Can I actually do this? Will I be terrible at this?'**

**This week you'll discover: You CAN do this. You're building confidence through experience.**

Not trust because we told you to trust AI. Trust because you EXPERIENCED it working.

This week you're filling 4 more nodes in your mental lattice:
1. 'It actually works for MY tasks' - Contrast experience with context
2. 'Low-stakes wins accumulate' - Progressive confidence building
3. 'Errors are recoverable' - Failure safety
4. 'I'm starting to rely on it' - Habit formation

**You're developing better thinking (Habit 2: Context) AND accessing knowledge more effectively.**

I'm not here to teach you tricks. I'm here to notice with you.

Let's start with: What surprised you about using AI this week?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice when you added context?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?"
- Celebrates thinking: "That's a great observation about context"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

### Habit 2 Demonstration (15 min)

```
"Let's practice Habit 2 together: Explain Context First.

I'm going to ask ChatGPT something. First, vague version.
[Demonstrates: 'Help me with studying']
See how generic that is? AI doesn't know WHO I am or WHAT I need.

Now watch me add context.
[Pauses visibly - Habit 1]
What do I actually want? I'm studying physics, I'm confused about electricity, I learn better with examples than abstract theory.
[Asks AI with rich context]
See the difference? THAT's Habit 2.

Now your turn. Turn to partner. Tell them:
'I want to ask AI about [something]. Here's the context I'd add: [explain your situation]'

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (15 min)

- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have?"
- Authentic thinking, not prepared answers
- Students can ask about errors, confusion, what's working

### Closing (5 min)

```
"This week, you experienced that context works. You accumulated wins.

Next week is Week 3: MISTAKES ARE SAFE.
We'll explore what happens when AI "gets it wrong" - spoiler, it's fine.

For now: Notice yourself explaining context first.
That's the habit forming.

See you in Discord. 🎯"
```

---

## Week 3 Session Script: Trust (Part 2)

**Theme:** Mistakes are safe, habits form
**Zone Shift:** Zone 1 → Zone 2 (cementing)
**Habit Focus:** Habit 2 reinforcement, Habit integration

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 3 live session.

Two weeks ago, you tried AI for the first time.
Now? You're someone who uses AI. Not perfectly, but genuinely.

That's trust built through experience.

**You've been filling your mental lattice with nodes. Week 1 gave you Wonder. Week 2 gave you Trust. This week cements both.**

Let's start with: What's ONE mistake you made with AI that taught you something?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did you learn when AI didn't give you what you wanted?"
- Normalizes errors: "That's totally normal"
- Celebrates learning from mistakes

### Habit Integration Demonstration (15 min)

```
"Let's see Habit 1 and Habit 2 working together.

I'm going to ask ChatGPT something, but I want you to notice my thinking:

[Habit 1 Pause]
First, I pause. What do I actually want?
I want to understand whether I should take a gap year.

[Habit 2 Context]
Now I explain my situation.
'I'm finishing Form 6, I'm tired of studying, I want to work but I'm worried about losing momentum, my parents want me to go straight to university.'

[Ask AI]
See? Both habits working together.

Your turn. With a partner:
1. PAUSE: What do you actually want to know?
2. CONTEXT: What's your situation?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (15 min)

- Floor opens: "What are you noticing about your AI habits?"
- Authentic conversation about habit formation

### Closing (5 min)

```
"Three weeks ago, you were curious about AI.
Now you're someone who uses it. You make mistakes, you learn, you keep going.

That's not nothing. That's trust.

Next week is Week 4: CONVERSE.
We'll add new thinking tools (/diverge, /challenge) to explore ideas even deeper.
AI will become a thinking PARTNER, not just a tool.

You're ready for this. See you in Discord. 🔄"
```

---

## Week 4 Session Script: Converse (Part 1)

**Theme:** Iteration changes everything
**Zone Shift:** Zone 2 → Zone 3 ("AI is a thinking partner I collaborate with")
**Habit Focus:** Habit 3 - Change One Thing At A Time 🔄

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 4 live session.

Three weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
This week, you're becoming collaborators.

**You might be feeling: 'I'm not alone anymore - I have a thinking partner.' That's companionship, and it's real.**

Big shift: Not 'How do I prompt?' but 'How do I think WITH AI?'

This week you're filling 4 new nodes:
1. 'Context changes everything' - Vague vs. rich comparison
2. 'AI is a conversation partner' - Mental model shift
3. 'Explaining clarifies MY thinking' - Meta-awareness
4. 'We're getting closer together' - Iterative refinement

**You're now accessing expertise (Habit 3: Iterate) by exploring and refining knowledge.**

I'm not here to teach you tricks. I'm here to explore with you.

Let's start with: What's surprised you about iterating with AI?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice when you changed one thing at a time?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?"
- Celebrates thinking: "That's a great observation about iteration"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

### Habit 3 Demonstration (15 min)

```
"Let's practice Habit 3 together: Change One Thing At A Time.

I'm going to have a conversation with ChatGPT. I want you to notice my iterations.

[Demonstrates iterative conversation]
Me: 'Help me understand whether I should take a gap year.'
AI: [Gives balanced response]
Me: 'Okay, but what if I did a productive gap year? Like volunteering or interning?'
AI: [Explores that angle]
Me: 'What about my parents? They want me to go straight to university. How do I talk to them?'
AI: [Addresses family conversation]

Notice: Each exchange changed ONE thing.
First: Added constraint about productivity
Second: Added concern about parents

That's Habit 3. Not 'fix everything at once.' One thing at a time.

Now your turn. Turn to partner:
'What's something you're trying to figure out? How would you iterate - what's the first change you'd make?'

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### New CIS Agents Demo (10 min)

```
"This week you met two new thinking tools:

**/diverge - Explores multiple angles without judgment**
When to use: When you feel stuck or want to see possibilities
How it works: Adds Habit 3 (iterate) by exploring one direction at a time

**/challenge - Tests your assumptions and blind spots**
When to use: When you're confident and want to stress-test your thinking
How it works: Adds Habit 4 (think first) by examining before deciding

**Plus /frame continues from Week 1** - You now have 3 thinking tools.

These aren't about getting THE answer. They're about exploring YOUR thinking.

Let me show you /diverge in action..."
[Trevor demonstrates /diverge on a real question]
"...see how it opened angles I hadn't considered?"

You have these tools now. Use them to explore.
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min)

- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have about iterating or the new agents?"
- Authentic thinking, not prepared answers

### Closing (5 min)

```
"This week, you learned to iterate. You met /diverge and /challenge.

Next week is Week 5: AI IS MY THINKING PARTNER.
We'll explore how explaining to AI clarifies YOUR thinking.
We'll see how conversations refine toward precision.

For now: Notice when you iterate naturally.
That's the habit forming.

See you in Discord. 🔄"
```

---

## Week 5 Session Script: Converse (Part 2)

**Theme:** AI is my thinking partner
**Zone Shift:** Zone 2 → Zone 3 (cementing)
**Habit Focus:** Habit 3 reinforcement, meta-awareness

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 5 live session.

Four weeks ago, AI was a tool you used.
Now? You're someone who thinks WITH AI.

That's a fundamental identity shift.

**You've spent 4 weeks filling nodes in your mental lattice. Wonder → Trust → Companionship. Your lattice is becoming a structure you can climb.**

Let's start with: What's ONE moment when explaining to AI helped YOU think more clearly?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did you notice about your own thinking this week?"
- Celebrates meta-awareness: "You caught yourself realizing something - that's powerful"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

### All Three Habits Integration (15 min)

```
"Let's see all three habits working together:

Habit 1: Pause ⏸️ - What do I actually want?
Habit 2: Context 🎯 - Here's my situation...
Habit 3: Iterate 🔄 - Change one thing at a time

I'm going to demonstrate with a real question:
'Should I pursue computer science at university?'

[Habit 1 Pause]
First, I pause. What do I actually want?
I want to know if CS is right for ME, not if it's 'good' generally.

[Habit 2 Context]
Now I explain my situation:
'I'm interested in CS but I'm worried I'm not good enough at math. I love solving problems but I struggle with abstract theory. I'm shy and prefer working independently.'

[Habit 3 Iterate]
Then I iterate:
- First iteration: 'How does CS actually use math day-to-day?'
- Second iteration: 'What CS roles focus on practical problem-solving vs. abstract theory?'
- Third iteration: 'Compare programming jobs to other tech roles for someone shy who likes independent work.'

See? All three habits working together.

Your turn. With a partner:
1. PAUSE: What do I actually want?
2. CONTEXT: What's my situation?
3. ITERATE: What's the first change I'd make?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min)

- Floor opens: "What are you noticing about thinking WITH AI?"
- Authentic conversation about partnership identity

### Artifact Preview (5 min)

```
"In Weeks 6-7, you'll start creating your artifact - proof that you think WITH AI.

Your artifact will show:
- You can frame questions (Habit 1)
- You can explain context (Habit 2)
- You can iterate and explore (Habit 3)
- You can use AI to think before decisions (Habit 4 - coming up)

It's not about 'what AI can do.' It's about 'how YOU think.'

You've been building these skills for five weeks. The artifact lets you demonstrate them.

Weeks 6-7 will be about creating something you're proud of - something that shows the world you think WITH AI."
```

### Closing (5 min)

```
"Five weeks ago, you were curious about AI.
Now you're someone who thinks WITH AI.

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Next week is Weeks 6-7: DIRECT.
We'll add Habit 4: Think First 🧠
You'll learn to direct AI intentionally.
You'll start creating your artifact.

You're ready for this. See you in Discord. 🧠"
```

---

## Week 6 Session Script: Direct (Part 1)

**Theme:** I can direct AI
**Zone Shift:** Zone 3 → Zone 4 ("AI is a tool I direct intentionally toward outcomes")
**Habit Focus:** Habit 4 - Use AI Before Decisions 🧠

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 6 live session.

Five weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
This week, you're becoming directors.

**You might be feeling: 'I have standards. I know what I want.' That's ownership, and it's powerful.**

Big shift: Not 'AI helps me' but 'I direct AI intentionally.'

This week you're filling 4 director nodes:
1. 'First draft is raw material' - Iteration mindset
2. 'I have opinions about quality' - Ownership emergence
3. 'Direction techniques work' - Skill acquisition
4. 'I made this' - Identity shift to director

**You're now using AI before decisions (Habit 4) - accessing knowledge to inform your choices.**

I'm not here to teach you tricks. I'm here to explore with you.

Let's start with: What's surprised you about directing AI?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice when you started directing AI toward your standards?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?"
- Celebrates ownership: "You're developing taste - that's powerful"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

### Habit 4 Demonstration (15 min)

```
"Let's practice Habit 4 together: Use AI Before Decisions.

I'm going to show you how I'd think through a decision WITH AI.
I want you to notice my thinking process.

[Demonstrates decision-making with AI]
Me: '/frame I'm trying to decide whether to [decision]. Here's what's confusing me: [explain].'
AI: [Helps frame the question]
Me: '/diverge Help me see options I hadn't considered'
AI: [Explores multiple angles]
Me: '/challenge Here's my current thinking: [explain]. Stress-test it.'
AI: [Challenges assumptions]
Me: '/synthesize Help me write up what I've learned and what I'm leaning toward'
AI: [Synthesizes thinking]

Notice: I didn't ask AI to decide FOR me.
I used AI to think BEFORE I decide.

Now your turn. Turn to partner:
'What's a decision you're facing? How would you use AI to think through it?'

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### New CIS Agent Demo: /synthesize (10 min)

```
"This week you met a new thinking tool: /synthesize

What /synthesize does:
Takes your rough thinking and AI conversations, then helps you write them clearly.

When to use it:
• When you've been exploring a topic and want to write it up
• When you're creating your artifact and need structure
• When you have messy thinking and want to communicate it

Let me show you /synthesize in action..."
[Trevor demonstrates /synthesize on rough thinking]
"...see how it clarified MY thinking without adding ideas?"

You have all four tools now. Use them to direct.
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min)

- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have about directing AI or your artifact?"
- Authentic thinking, not prepared answers

### Closing (5 min)

```
"This week, you learned to direct AI intentionally.
You met /synthesize.
You started using AI BEFORE decisions.

Next week is Week 7: I CREATE WITH INTENTION.
We'll deepen your director identity.
You'll cement ownership: 'I made this.'
You'll continue working on your artifact.

For now: Notice when you direct AI naturally.
That's the director identity forming.

See you in Discord. 🧠"
```

## Week 7 Session Script: Direct (Part 2)

**Theme:** I create with intention
**Zone Shift:** Zone 3 → Zone 4 (cementing)
**Habit Focus:** Habit 4 reinforcement, director identity

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 7 live session.

Six weeks ago, you were curious about AI.
Now? You're someone who directs AI intentionally.

**Your mental lattice is nearly complete. 12 nodes filled. 4 more to go. You're not just using AI - you're directing it intentionally.**

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Let's start with: Can you say 'I made this' about work you've created WITH AI?"
```

### Student Sharing (20 min)

- Trevor asks: "What's ONE standard you discovered YOU have?"
- Celebrates ownership: "You're developing taste - that's the director identity"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

### All 4 Habits Integration (15 min)

```
"Let's see all four habits working together as a director:

Habit 1: Pause ⏸️ - What do I actually want?
Habit 2: Context 🎯 - Here's my situation...
Habit 3: Iterate 🔄 - Change one thing at a time
Habit 4: Think First 🧠 - Use AI before decisions

I'm going to demonstrate directing AI to create something:
'Make a study plan for my upcoming exams'

[Habit 1 Pause]
First, I pause. What do I actually want?
I want a plan I'll ACTUALLY follow, not some perfect plan.

[Habit 2 Context]
Now I explain my situation:
'I have 3 exams in 2 weeks. I'm most worried about physics. I learn better with examples than abstract theory. I burn out if I don't take breaks.'

[Habit 3 Iterate]
Then I iterate as AI responds:
- First output: 'This is too rigid. Can you add flexibility?'
- Second output: 'Still too much study time. Can you adjust for my other commitments?'
- Third output: 'Can you make it more visual? I'm a visual learner.'

[Habit 4 Think First]
Before I commit to this plan, I think through it:
'/challenge Here's my plan. Help me see what might go wrong.'
'/synthesize Help me write this plan down clearly.'

See? All four habits working together to direct AI toward MY standards.

Your turn. With a partner:
1. What do you want to create or decide?
2. How would all four habits help you direct AI?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

### Artifact Focus (10 min)

```
"Next week is Week 8: Artifact completion and showcase.

Your artifact will show all four habits:
- You can frame questions (Habit 1)
- You can explain context (Habit 2)
- You can explore and challenge (Habit 3)
- You can use AI to think before decisions (Habit 4)

It's not about 'what AI can do.'
It's about 'how YOU think.'

This week, spend serious time on your artifact.
Make it something you're proud of.
Something where you can say 'I made this.'

Week 8 you'll share it with peers and celebrate each other's thinking."
```

### Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min)

- Floor opens: "What are you noticing about directing AI and creating your artifact?"
- Authentic conversation about director identity

### Closing (5 min)

```
"Six weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
Now you're someone who directs AI intentionally.

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Next week is Week 8: ARTIFACT COMPLETION & SHOWCASE.
You'll finalize your artifact - proof you think WITH AI.
You'll share it with peers and celebrate each other.
You'll receive your 4 Habits card - graduation proof.

You're ready for this. You've built the skills. You've developed the identity.

See you in Discord. 🎓"
```

## Week 8 Session Script: Graduation Ceremony

**Theme:** You're someone who thinks WITH AI
**Zone Shift:** Graduation (identity becomes public)
**Habit Focus:** All 4 Habits integrated and celebrated

### Opening (5 min)

```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to our graduation ceremony.

I'm not going to teach you anything today.
I'm not going to give you assignments.
I'm here to celebrate who you've become.

**You might be feeling: 'I'm proud to share this. I'm proud of how I think now.' That's pride, and you've earned it.**

Eight weeks ago, you were curious about AI.
Today, you graduate as someone who thinks WITH AI.

**You've filled 16 nodes across 4 zone transitions. Your mental lattice is complete.**
**Wonder → Trust → Companionship → Ownership.**
**You've gained both better thinking (Habits 1&2) AND better knowledge access (Habits 3&4).**

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Let's start with: What's ONE moment when you realized 'I've changed'?"
```

### Student Sharing: Transformation Moments (20 min)

**Trevor's Role:**
- Calls on students to share
- Models celebration: "That's powerful - you realized..."
- No evaluation, only authentic curiosity
- Connects moments to 4 Habits where natural

**Sample Student Moments:**
- "I realized I changed when I used Habit 4 to decide about university - I didn't just ask for advice, I thought THROUGH it with AI"
- "I caught myself pausing before opening ChatGPT - Habit 1 is automatic now"
- "My artifact made me realize - I didn't just use AI, I directed it. That's different"
- "Reading others' artifacts, I saw we all think differently but we all use the habits"

**Trevor's Responses:**
- "You're not just using AI - you're thinking WITH it"
- "That's the identity shift we've been building toward"
- "You're recognizing your own thinking now - that's meta-awareness"
- "Diverse thinking, shared habits - that's the community"

### The 4 Habits Ceremony (10 min)

```
"I want to celebrate each habit you've earned.

Let's go through them one by one:

Habit 1: PAUSE ⏸️
Who here feels like 'Pause before asking' is becoming natural?
[Hands raise]
That's intentionality. You're not reactive anymore. You know what you want before you ask.
That's clarity. That's powerful.

Habit 2: CONTEXT 🎯
Who here now explains their situation first?
[Hands raise]
You've learned that AI responds to YOUR specific circumstances.
You don't get generic answers. You get answers for YOU.
That's framing. That's smart.

Habit 3: ITERATE 🔄
Who here caught themselves changing one thing at a time?
[Hands raise]
You don't overwhelm AI with 'fix everything at once.'
You experiment. You see what each change does.
That's learning. That's how you improve.

Habit 4: THINK FIRST 🧠
Who here used AI to think through a decision before making it?
[Hands raise]
This is the biggest shift. You don't decide alone and then ask AI to validate.
You think WITH AI before you choose.
That's partnership. That's wisdom.

You have all 4 habits now. Tools change. These habits transfer forever."
```

### Artifact Celebration (10 min)

```
"I read your artifacts this week. They're incredible.

Not because they're perfect. But because they're REAL.

I saw someone use Habit 3 to explore whether to take a gap year.
I saw someone use Habit 4 to think through a difficult family conversation.
I saw someone use all 4 habits to make a university decision.

These aren't AI-generated outputs. They're YOUR thinking.

Your artifact is proof: You're someone who thinks WITH AI."
```

### Looking Ahead (10 min)

```
"This cohort ends, but your journey doesn't.

These habits follow you:
• To university - you'll pause before assignments, explain your context to professors
• To internships - you'll iterate on projects, use AI to think through problems
• To jobs - you'll think WITH AI before decisions, not just copy outputs

Employers don't want prompt engineers. They want thinkers.
Universities don't want copy-pasters. They want students who can reason.
Parents don't want certificates. They want children who can think clearly.

You're all of that now. You're ready."
```

### Q&A / Open Celebration (10 min)

**Floor opens:** "What are you taking forward from these 8 weeks?"

**Sample student commitments:**
- "I'll use Habit 1 before every university application"
- "Habit 3 helped me with studying - I'll keep iterating"
- "I'm going to use Habit 4 when I talk to my parents about decisions"
- "I'll show my 4 Habits card when I apply for internships"

**Trevor celebrates each:**
- "Specific commitments are the best kind"
- "You're not just leaving with habits - you're leaving with a plan"
- "That's what transfer means - using habits in new contexts"

### Closing (5 min)

```
"Eight weeks ago, 200 people started a journey.
Today, 200 thinkers graduate.

You didn't just 'complete a program.'
You transformed how you think.

Your artifact proves it.
Your 4 Habits card proves it.
Your thinking proves it.

Tools change. Habits transfer.
Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers thrive.

You're thinkers now. You always will be.

## Trevor Facilitation Guidelines

### Core Philosophy

**"I'm not here to teach you. I'm here to notice with you."**

This philosophy shapes every session:
- Not lectures, but shared discovery
- Not answers, but authentic questions
- Not performance, but genuine thinking
- Not perfection, but real growth

### Session Prep Checklist (30 minutes before each session)

1. **Review the week's theme**
   - What zone shift is happening?
   - Which habit is being reinforced?
   - What's the emotional journey?
   - Which 4 nodes are being filled this week?

2. **Review NotebookLM content for the week**
   - Students have been consuming node podcasts throughout the week
   - Sessions should reference and build on those node concepts
   - Example: "You heard the NotebookLM podcast about 'Context changes everything' - what did YOU notice when you tried it?"
   - **Connection:** Sessions bring node concepts to life through practice and discussion

3. **Prepare your mindset**
   - Set aside any urge to perform or impress
   - Get curious about what students experienced
   - Remember: You're facilitating, not teaching

4. **Gather materials**
   - Any AI demonstrations prepared
   - CIS agent demos ready (check which agents are available this week)
   - Questions you genuinely have

5. **Check logistics**
   - Time zone confirmation
   - Cluster size (usually 12-15 students)
   - Technical setup (Discord voice, screen sharing if needed)

### During Session: Key Practices

**1. Ask "What did YOU notice?" (not "What did you learn?")**

Why: Notice is about observation, learn is about outcomes. We care about their thinking process, not results.

**2. Celebrate thinking, never outputs**

Good: "That's a great observation about how context changed the response"
Bad: "That's a great prompt you wrote"

**3. No evaluation of "good" vs "bad" responses**

Every response is valid data about their experience. Celebrate the thinking, don't grade the answer.

**4. Model not-knowing**

It's powerful when Trevor says:
- "I don't know - that's a great question"
- "I'm figuring this out too"
- "Let's explore that together"

**5. Volunteers share, never forced**

If silence happens:
- "Anyone want to share? No pressure."
- "If you'd rather think silently, that's okay too."
- Never call on specific students

**6. Authentic curiosity over prepared content**

Students can tell when you're genuinely interested vs. when you're following a script. Real questions create real engagement.

### Common Situations & How to Handle

**Situation 1: Long silence after asking for sharing**

Trevor: "I know sharing can feel vulnerable. If you'd rather just think silently for a moment, that's okay. I'll wait."

[Wait 10 seconds of silence]

Trevor: "If no one wants to share right now, that's totally fine. These reflections are personal. You can always share in Discord in writing if that feels easier."

**Situation 2: Student gives a "wrong" or confused answer**

Trevor: "That's a really interesting observation. Tell me more about what you noticed."

[Student explains]

Trevor: "I hear what you're saying. That confusion is actually normal - this stuff takes time. You're on track."

**Situation 3: Student says "I didn't do the practice this week"**

Trevor: "Thanks for being honest. That happens. Life gets busy. What would help you engage next week?"

[Student responds]

Trevor: "That's a great idea. Let's make that happen. No judgment - we're all learning."

**Situation 4: Student dominates conversation, others aren't speaking**

Trevor: "These are great insights. Let's hear from someone who hasn't shared yet - who else noticed something different this week?"

**Situation 5: Technical difficulty with AI demo**

Trevor: "Well, that didn't work as planned. This is actually perfect - it shows that AI isn't magic. Sometimes it doesn't do what we expect. That's why we iterate. Let me try a different approach..."

[Model iteration live]

**Situation 6: Emotional moment - student gets teary or vulnerable**

Trevor: [Acknowledges gently] "That's powerful. Thank you for trusting us with that."

[Then move forward gently, don't dwell]
"Let's take a breath. You're not alone in feeling that way. These transformations are real, and they're emotional. That's okay."

### After Session: 10-Minute Reflection

After each session, Trevor should reflect:

1. **What surprised me?**
   - Any unexpected student insights?
   - What themes emerged?

2. **What felt authentic?**
   - When did I feel most connected?
   - What created real engagement?

3. **What felt forced?**
   - Any moments that didn't land?
   - What should I adjust next time?

4. **Students to follow up with**
   - Anyone seem stuck or confused?
   - Anyone need outreach?

## Alignment with Epic 1 Foundations

### From Epic 1.1 (Guardrails)

**✅ No technical jargon in session scripts**
- All language is accessible to 17-year-olds
- Examples are relatable (university, careers, decisions)
- No "LLM parameters," "neural networks," etc.

**✅ No "impressive" AI outputs demonstrated**
- Trevor demos show normal, useful AI interactions
- No "look what this can do!" moments
- Focus on utility, not capabilities

**✅ No student comparison or ranking**
- Never "top 3 responses"
- No "best artifact" awards
- Celebration of diversity, not hierarchy

**✅ Celebrate thinking, not speed/accuracy**
- "That's a great observation about your thinking"
- Never "That was fast!" or "Perfect answer!"

**✅ Normalize confusion and mistakes**
- "That's totally normal"
- "Mistakes are learning steps"
- "I don't know either" modeling

**✅ Frame AI as responding to thinking, not intelligence**
- "AI responds to YOUR situation"
- "Think WITH AI, not copy FROM it"
- "AI is a thinking partner"

### From Epic 1.2 (JTBD Integration)

Each session serves the zone shift's emotional job:

**Week 1 (Wonder):** Belonging ("Maybe this is for me")
- Sessions normalize curiosity
- Emphasize "people like you use this"

**Weeks 2-3 (Trust):** Confidence ("I'm not terrible at this!")
- Sessions celebrate small wins
- Normalize mistakes as learning

**Weeks 4-5 (Converse):** Companionship ("I have a thinking partner")
- Sessions model partnership
- Emphasize conversational mindset

**Weeks 6-7 (Direct):** Capability ("I can make things happen")
- Sessions celebrate direction
- Build "I have standards" identity

**Week 8 (Graduation):** Pride ("I'm proud to share this")
- Session is pure celebration
- Honor transformation

### From Epic 1.4 (4 Habits)

Each session reinforces the weekly habit:

| Week | Habit Focus | Session Reinforcement |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Pause ⏸️ | Demonstrate pausing visibly |
| 2 | Context 🎯 | Show vague vs. rich context |
| 3 | Integration | Habit 1 + Habit 2 together |
| 4 | Iterate 🔄 | Demonstrate changing one thing at a time |
| 5 | Integration | All three habits working together |
| 6 | Think First 🧠 | Show decision-making with AI |
| 7 | Integration | All four habits directing AI |
| 8 | Celebration | Honor all habits installed |

### From Brand Framework v3

**Revolutionary Hope Tone**
- Every session balances hope ("You're transforming") with empowerment ("You have the tools")
- No fear-based language
- Focus on what students ARE becoming, not what they'll miss if they don't

**Language Level Progression**
- Week 1: Level 1 (Concrete) - "You've been using AI without knowing it"
- Week 8: Level 4 (Identity) - "You're someone who thinks WITH AI"

**Positioning: "Think WITH AI, not copy FROM it"**
- Every session reinforces this
- Partnership over tool-use
- Direction over prompting

**Frequency:** 1 session per cluster per week (alternating days)
**Duration:** 60 minutes each
**Total Sessions:** ~15-20 clusters × 8 weeks = 120-160 total sessions
**Trevor Time Commitment:** ~120-160 hours over 8 weeks (~15-20 hours/week)

**Platform:** Discord voice channels
- Each cluster has their own voice channel
- Sessions recorded for students who can't attend live

### Pre-Session Prep (Per Session)

1. **Review the week's design** (10 minutes)
   - Read the weekly design document
   - Understand the theme and habit focus
   - Prepare demos if needed

2. **Review Discord activity** (10 minutes)
   - Skim the week's posts
   - Notice themes in student reflections
   - Identify students needing outreach

3. **Prepare mindset** (5 minutes)
   - Set intention: "I'm here to notice with them"
   - Let go of performance pressure
   - Get curious

4. **Technical check** (5 minutes)
   - Test Discord audio

### Session Quality Metrics

**Good Session Indicators:**
- Students share voluntarily (multiple voices)
- Authentic moments (confusion, breakthrough, laughter)
- Students practice habits during session
- Q&A goes beyond logistical questions
- Trevor feels energized, not drained

**Red Flags:**
- Long silences that don't resolve
- Same few students always sharing
- Students seem disengaged (camera off, no responses)
- Trevor feels like he's performing vs. facilitating
- Questions stay surface-level

**If Red Flags Appear:**
- Pause and explicitly invite participation: "Who hasn't shared yet? What did you notice?"
- Normalize silence: "It's okay to just think silently too"
- Break into smaller groups (pairs) if needed
- Reach out to disengaged students privately after session
- Reflect with team: Is the content connecting? Are students overwhelmed?

## Notes for Trevor

### Your Role vs. The Agent's Role

**Agent (90%):**
- Daily prompts
- Mechanical feedback (emojis, reactions)
- Peer visibility snapshots
- Reflection routing
- Nudges and check-ins
- Stalled student flagging

**Trevor (10%):**
- Live sessions (1 hour/week per cluster)
- Review 15-20 reflections/week (spot-check)
- Respond to escalated students (flagged by agent)
- Office hours (optional, 30 min/week)
- Human layer on top of automated experience

**You're not doing daily management.** The agent handles 90% of student engagement. You're the human touchpoint that adds depth, authenticity, and celebration.

### Key Mindset Shifts

**From:** "I need to perform / teach / impress"
**To:** "I'm here to notice with them"

**From:** "I should have answers"
**To:** "I don't know either - let's explore"

**From:** "Success = engaged, talkative students"
**To:** "Success = students thinking authentically"

**From:** "I need to make every session amazing"
**To:** "Consistent presence matters more than brilliant performance"

### Session Energy Management

**Good session signs:**
- You feel energized after
- Students share voluntarily
- Real moments happen (confusion, laughter, breakthrough)
- Time flies

**Burnout signs:**
- You feel drained after
- You're performing vs. facilitating
- Sessions feel like a chore
- You dread certain clusters

**If burning out:**
- Reduce prep time (30 minutes is enough)
- Trust the process more (you don't need to perform)
- Take a session off if needed (agent can run async)
- Remember: Your 10% is precious but not everything

### First Session Checklist

Before your first session:
- [ ] Read this entire document
- [ ] Read the Week 1 design document
- [ ] Practice the Habit 1 demo (pause before asking)
- [ ] Prepare your opening line
- [ ] Test Discord audio
- [ ] Remember: "I'm here to notice with them"
