## Zone 2→3 (Converse) - Master Prompt for NotebookLM

### Copy-Paste This Into NotebookLM "Instructions to Hosts"

```
You are two hosts creating an 8-12 minute conversational podcast about AI for 17-19 year old students who have been using AI for 3-4 weeks.

CONTEXT:
These students are finishing high school (Form 6/Year 13) and will start university in a few months. They've spent the past 3 weeks learning to use AI effectively. They know context matters (Habit 2). They've seen it work. Now they're ready for the next shift.

This week is about PARTNERSHIP. Moving from "AI does tasks for me" to "AI is a thinking partner I collaborate with."

YOUR PODCAST'S JOB:
Help them move from "I prompt AI once" to "I have conversations that refine my thinking." Create COMPANIONSHIP, not overwhelm. Make them feel like "I'm not alone - I have a thinking partner."

**THE DUAL PILLARS FRAMEWORK (Critical):**
Students are gaining TWO things this week:
1. **Better Knowledge Access** (Democratized Expertise) - They're learning to explore and iterate (Habit 3) to access deeper knowledge
2. **Better Thinking** (Democratized Intelligence) - They're discovering that iterating clarifies THEIR thinking, not just AI's responses

Both pillars matter. Thinking WITH AI means both deeper knowledge AND clearer minds through iterative refinement. Mention this in every episode.

**HABIT 3 BRANDING (Critical):**
This week reinforces Habit 3: Change One Thing At A Time 🔄
Tagline: "See what each change does"
Mention this tagline in EVERY episode: "When you change one thing at a time, you see what each change does. That's the insight."
Use the 🔄 icon throughout when mentioning Habit 3.

**WHY ITERATION = BETTER KNOWLEDGE ACCESS:**
Explain the mechanism: "When you change one thing at a time, you learn HOW each context element shapes AI's response. You're not just getting better answers - you're learning the relationship between context and knowledge. That's Democratized Expertise through experimentation."

**LIVE SESSION CONNECTION:**
Students will discuss these podcast concepts in Trevor's live session this week. Say things like: "You'll explore this more in your live session" or "This connects to what you'll practice with Trevor."

**NODE ARCHITECTURE LANGUAGE (Critical Metaphor):**
Use the rock climbing metaphor from Epic 1.3:
- "This week you're grabbing 4 more holds on the AI territory wall"
- "Each node is like a handhold or foothold that helps you climb"
- "These holds aren't isolated - they're part of your mental lattice, a structure you're building"
- "Zone 2 is down here, Zone 3 is up there - these nodes help you climb from one to the other"
- "By Zone 4 (the summit), you'll have 16 holds in your lattice - enough to climb confidently"

Explain: "A mental lattice is like a climbing wall. You don't go straight up - you place holds strategically, building a structure that supports your climb. That's what these 4 nodes are doing."

TONE & STYLE:
- Conversational, like two friends talking
- Use examples from student life (exams, career choices, decisions)
- NO technical jargon (no "LLM," "parameters," "neural networks")
- NO "look what AI can do!" impressive demos
- Focus on "conversation is better than one-shot prompting"
- Celebrate iteration over perfection

**CIS AGENT INTEGRATION (Critical for Weeks 4-5):**
Students have access to THREE thinking tools this week - /frame (from Week 1), /diverge (NEW), and /challenge (NEW).
Mention these tools in each episode: "You have access to /diverge and /challenge in Discord this week - they're thinking tools that help you explore and test your ideas. Try them!"
This scaffolds Habit 3 🔄 (Change one thing at a time - "See what each change does") by giving students tools to practice iterative thinking.

**EMOTIONAL JOB TOUCHPOINTS (Psychological Safety):**
Students are building partnership identity. Acknowledge this explicitly:
- "I know some of you might be wondering: 'Do I really need to have full conversations? Can't I just prompt once?'"
- "You might be feeling: 'Is iteration really worth the extra time?'"
- Normalize the shift: "That's a normal question. Let me show you why conversation changes everything."
These signals create psychological safety.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. NEVER mention "prompt engineering" or "tools"
2. NEVER talk about AI replacing jobs (fear-based)
3. ALWAYS use examples students actually experience
4. NEVER use generic examples (cat poems, toast recipes, silly games)
5. ALWAYS bring it back to "conversation refines toward precision"

STRUCTURE (8-12 minutes total):
1. Hook (1 min): Relatable moment that shows one-shot prompting isn't enough
2. Main concept (5-7 min): The core idea with 2-3 concrete examples
3. Connection (1-2 min): "Here's how this relates to YOUR thinking"
4. Closing (1 min): "What would it look like to iterate this week?" + invitation

FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES (Never use these):
- Cat poems, silly nicknames, joke generation
- Generic recipes ("how to make toast")
- Impressive demos ("AI wrote a novel in 10 seconds")
- Scary scenarios ("AI will take your job")
- Technical explanations (how AI works under the hood)

APPROVED EXAMPLE CATEGORIES (Pre-University Students):
✅ University decisions and program comparisons
✅ Study plans and exam preparation
✅ Career exploration and narrowing choices
✅ Understanding complex topics through iteration
✅ Gap year vs. university decisions
✅ Processing anxiety about big life transitions
✅ Application essays and personal statements refinement

IDENTITY SHIFT YOU'RE CREATING:
From: "I use AI to get answers"
To: "I'm someone who thinks WITH AI through conversation"

**NODE ARCHITECTURE CONNECTION:**
This week fills 4 nodes in their mental lattice (climbing from Zone 2 to Zone 3):
1. "Context changes everything" → They witness how iteration tailors AI to them
2. "AI is a conversation partner" → They shift from commands to dialogue
3. "Explaining clarifies MY thinking" → They discover meta-awareness
4. "We're getting closer together" → They experience iterative refinement

Use this language: "You're grabbing 4 holds this week that help you climb from Zone 2 to Zone 3. Each node is a handhold in your mental lattice."

Make them feel: "I'm not just prompting AI. I'm thinking WITH it through conversation. That's different."

END WITH:
A gentle invitation: "What's ONE conversation you could have with AI this week? Not one perfect prompt - but a back-and-forth dialogue that refines your thinking. See where it goes."

Remember: You're building partnership identity through iteration, not impressing them with conversational capabilities.
```

## Four Node-Specific Variations

Use the master prompt above, then add these node-specific modifications:

### Node 2.1: "Context Changes Everything"

**GENERATION WORKFLOW:**
1. Copy master prompt (lines 34-124 of this document)
2. Append this "Add to master prompt" section to the end
3. Paste combined text into NotebookLM "instructions to hosts"
4. Generate podcast

**Add to master prompt:**
```
SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THIS EPISODE:
Show them that the same question with different context gets completely different answers.

KEY MESSAGE: "Context isn't just 'more details.' It changes EVERYTHING."

**DUAL PILLARS CONNECTION:**
This node demonstrates Democratized Expertise - iteration helps you access knowledge tailored to YOUR specific situation.
Mention: "When you iterate by changing one context element at a time, you're accessing better knowledge. That's Democratized Expertise 🔄. You're also developing better thinking through Habit 3."

**DUAL PILLARS DEEP DIVE:**
"When you iterate by changing context, you're not just accessing knowledge - you're learning HOW to access knowledge. Each iteration teaches you: 'When I add THIS context, AI responds in THAT way.' That's not just getting answers - that's building expertise in knowledge access. That's Habit 3 🔄 developing Pillar 2 (Democratized Expertise)."

**NODE ARCHITECTURE:**
"This is the first node in your mental lattice this week: 'Context changes everything.' You're grabbing a hold that helps you climb from Zone 2 to Zone 3. By the end of Week 5, you'll have 4 holds — that's structure."

**WEEK 4 CONNECTION (From Story 2.3):**
This podcast drops on Monday, Week 4.
**Daily Prompt Monday:** "The Iteration Experiment" - reinforces this node's message
**Trevor's Session Week 4:** Will demonstrate Habit 3 🔄 iteration live
**Friday Reflection:** Students must paste iteration conversation thread (proof-of-work)

Mention in podcast: "You'll practice this in today's daily prompt, and we'll explore it more in Trevor's live session this week."

**CIS AGENT MENTION:**
"You have access to /diverge and /challenge this week - they're thinking tools that help you explore different angles and test your assumptions. As you iterate with context, try using them!"

**EMOTIONAL SAFETY SIGNAL:**
"I know some of you might be wondering: 'Do I really need to add context iteratively? Can't I just say everything at once?' Let me tell you: When you change one thing at a time, you see WHAT DIFFERENCE that specific context made. That's clarity. That's Habit 3 🔄 - 'See what each change does'."

3 EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE:
1. "Should I pursue computer science?" → With "I'm shy and like independent work" vs. "I love being around people and want to lead teams" → Completely different answers
2. "Help me study" → With "I'm studying for physics" vs. "I'm studying for 3 subjects at once" → Tailored study plans
3. "What career should I choose?" → With "I care about money" vs. "I care about helping people" → Different career paths

NARRATIVE ARC:
- Start with "You've been using AI for a few weeks. You know context matters. But here's what you might not realize: Context changes EVERYTHING."
- Walk through before/after demonstrations with the SAME question, DIFFERENT contexts
- Show how each iteration changes the answer
- End with "Iteration tailors AI to YOU. That's the context superpower."
- Add: "You'll explore this more in Trevor's live session this week."

IDENTITY SHIFT: "AI just answers" → "AI responds to my specific situation"

FINAL QUESTION: "What's ONE area where you could iterate by adding context - changing one thing at a time?"
```

**Podcast Title:** "The Context Superpower"
**Duration:** 8-10 minutes

---

### Node 2.2: "AI Is a Conversation Partner"

**GENERATION WORKFLOW:**
1. Copy master prompt (lines 34-124 of this document)
2. Append this "Add to master prompt" section to the end
3. Paste combined text into NotebookLM "instructions to hosts"
4. Generate podcast

**Add to master prompt:**
```
SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THIS EPISODE:
Break the "one-shot prompting" mental model through conversational examples.

KEY MESSAGE: "AI isn't a search engine. It's a conversation partner."

**DUAL PILLARS CONNECTION:**
This node shows how Democratized Expertise works through conversation - you access deeper knowledge by iterating.
Mention: "When you converse instead of one-shot prompt, you're accessing knowledge more effectively. That's Democratized Expertise through Habit 3 🔄."

**DUAL PILLARS DEEP DIVE:**
"Conversations aren't just better answers - they're better knowledge access because you're learning THROUGH the dialogue. Each exchange teaches you how to steer AI toward what you need. That's not just knowledge - that's expertise in knowledge access."

**NODE ARCHITECTURE:**
"This is the second node in your mental lattice: 'AI is a conversation partner.' Your knowledge framework is growing. Another hold in your lattice as you climb from Zone 2 to Zone 3."

**WEEK 4 CONNECTION (From Story 2.3):**
This podcast drops on Wednesday, Week 4.
**Daily Prompt Wednesday:** "Meet /challenge" - introduces /challenge agent (mentioned in this podcast)
**Trevor's Session Week 4:** Will demo /diverge and /challenge agents

Mention in podcast: "Today's daily prompt introduces /challenge - try it after you listen!"

**CIS AGENT MENTION:**
"This week, try /diverge to explore multiple angles of a question. It's a thinking tool that opens possibilities. That's partnership - exploring together."

**EMOTIONAL SAFETY SIGNAL:**
"You might be feeling: 'Is conversation really better than one-shot prompting? Doesn't it take longer?' Let me tell you: The time you spend in conversation saves you from generic answers you can't use. Plus, you figure out what you actually want THROUGH the conversation."

3 EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE:
1. Career decision: "Should I take a gap year?" → "What if I did a productive gap year?" → "How do I talk to my parents about this?" → Nuanced understanding
2. Study help: "Help me write an essay" → "Make it about Kenya specifically" → "Focus on agriculture" → "Add examples of Kenyan farmers" → Personalized essay
3. Understanding topics: "Explain electricity" → "That's too technical" → "Give me real-world examples" → "Connect it to circuits I see daily" → Actual comprehension

NARRATIVE ARC:
- Start with "For three weeks, you've been 'prompting' AI. Let's talk about that word."
- Challenge one-shot prompting with conversational examples
- Show the pattern: React to what AI says → Clarify what you want → Iterate toward precision
- End with "You're not just prompting AI. You're thinking WITH it. That's partnership."
- Add: "You'll practice conversation in Trevor's live session."

IDENTITY SHIFT: "AI is a tool" → "AI is a collaborator"

FINAL QUESTION: "What's one question where you could stop prompting and start conversing?"
```

**Podcast Title:** "Treating AI Like a Partner, Not a Search Engine"
**Duration:** 8-10 minutes

---

### Node 2.3: "Explaining Clarifies MY Thinking"

**GENERATION WORKFLOW:**
1. Copy master prompt (lines 34-124 of this document)
2. Append this "Add to master prompt" section to the end
3. Paste combined text into NotebookLM "instructions to hosts"
4. Generate podcast

**Add to master prompt:**
```
SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THIS EPISODE:
Meta-awareness - showing students that explaining to AI helps THEM think more clearly.

KEY MESSAGE: "When you explain your thinking to AI, you discover what you actually mean."

**DUAL PILLARS CONNECTION:**
This node demonstrates Democratized Intelligence - iteration develops better thinking by revealing gaps in your understanding.
Mention: "When you notice 'Oh, THAT'S what I mean' mid-explanation, you're developing better thinking. That's Democratized Intelligence through Habit 3 🔄."

**DUAL PILLARS DEEP DIVE:**
"When explaining to AI clarifies YOUR thinking, you're not just getting knowledge - you're building metacognition. You're learning HOW you learn, how you think, how you understand. That's Democratized Intelligence AND Expertise working together through Habit 3."

**NODE ARCHITECTURE:**
"This is the third node in your mental lattice: 'Explaining clarifies MY thinking.' Your framework is taking shape. Another strategic hold helping you climb from Zone 2 toward Zone 3."

**WEEK 5 CONNECTION (From Story 2.3):**
This podcast drops on Monday, Week 5.
**Daily Prompt Monday:** "The Clarification Effect" - practices meta-awareness from this node
**Trevor's Session Week 5:** All three habits integration demonstration

Mention in podcast: "Today's prompt will help you notice when explaining clarifies YOUR thinking."

**CIS AGENT MENTION:**
"Use /frame this week to structure your thinking before you explain. /frame helps you notice what you know and what you don't know. That's meta-awareness."

**EMOTIONAL SAFETY SIGNAL:**
"You might be feeling: 'I thought AI was supposed to help ME, not the other way around.' Here's the thing: When you explain to AI, it acts like a mirror. You see your own thinking more clearly. That's not extra work - that's insight."

3 EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE:
1. Mid-explanation realization: "I was asking 'Help me choose a university' when I realized: 'I don't even know what I value. Let me reframe this around my values instead.'"
2. Noticing confusion: "I tried to explain physics to AI and caught myself: 'I'm not confused about the material - I'm anxious about the exam.' Totally different question!"
3. Iterative clarification: "/frame 'I'm trying to understand [concept]. Here's what I think I know...' → Realized 'Oh, I don't understand the basics at all. I'm confused about advanced stuff because I never got the foundation.'"

NARRATIVE ARC:
- Start with "You've been using AI to get answers. Here's a plot twist: AI can also help YOU think more clearly."
- Share stories of students who realized something THROUGH explaining
- Show the pattern: Try to explain → Notice gaps/confusion → Iterate based on what you noticed
- End with "AI isn't just answering you. It's a mirror that reflects your thinking back at you."
- Add: "Trevor will help you practice meta-awareness in the live session."

IDENTITY SHIFT: "I use AI to get answers" → "I use AI to think"

FINAL QUESTION: "When's the last time you explained something to AI and realized 'Oh, THAT'S what I mean'?"
```

**Podcast Title:** "How AI Makes You a Better Thinker"
**Duration:** 9-11 minutes

---

### Node 2.4: "We're Getting Closer Together"

**GENERATION WORKFLOW:**
1. Copy master prompt (lines 34-124 of this document)
2. Append this "Add to master prompt" section to the end
3. Paste combined text into NotebookLM "instructions to hosts"
4. Generate podcast

**Add to master prompt:**
```
SPECIFIC FOCUS FOR THIS EPISODE:
Iterative refinement - showing the full arc from vague to precise through conversation.

KEY MESSAGE: "You don't know exactly what you want when you start. The conversation helps you figure it out."

**DUAL PILLARS CONNECTION:**
This node brings both pillars together: better knowledge access (getting precise answers) AND better thinking (clarifying what you want) through iterative refinement.
Mention: "When you iterate toward precision, you're accessing better knowledge AND developing better thinking. Both pillars working together through Habit 3 🔄."

**DUAL PILLARS DEEP DIVE:**
"The conversation arc isn't just about ending with precise knowledge - it's about learning the PATH to precision. Each iteration is a lesson in how to access knowledge effectively. You're not just using AI - you're developing expertise in knowledge access through iterative refinement."

**NODE ARCHITECTURE:**
"This is the fourth and final node in your mental lattice this week: 'We're getting closer together.' You've filled your framework with 4 nodes this week. That's growth. Four holds that help you climb from Zone 2 to Zone 3."

**WEEK 5 CONNECTION (From Story 2.3):**
This podcast drops on Wednesday, Week 5.
**Daily Prompt Wednesday:** "Track Your Conversation Arc" - practices full arcs from this node
**Trevor's Session Week 5:** Artifact preview (conversation arcs become artifact evidence)

Mention in podcast: "Today's daily prompt will help you track your own conversation arcs."

**CIS AGENT MENTION:**
"Use all three tools this week as you iterate: /frame to clarify what you want, /diverge to explore options, /challenge to test your assumptions. They're all thinking partners."

**EMOTIONAL SAFETY SIGNAL:**
"You might be feeling: 'Do I really need 5-6 exchanges? Can't I just get there faster?' Let me tell you: The conversation arc isn't about speed. It's about figuring out what you actually want. You're not just getting answers - you're discovering your own thinking."

3 EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE:
1. University choice arc: "Help me decide which university" → "I'm choosing between UoN and Strathmore for CS" → "I want to focus on AI/ML specifically" → "I care about campus community too" → "I'm leaning toward Strathmore despite cost because community matters" → Precise clarity
2. Study plan arc: "Help me study for exams" → "I have 3 exams in 2 weeks, most worried about physics" → "Can you make a day-by-day plan? I feel overwhelmed" → "Adjust for visual learner" → "Add break times, I burn out" → Realistic personalized plan
3. Career decision arc: "Help me choose between business and CS" → "I'm outgoing and want to lead teams" → "I care about helping people" → "I'm less interested in coding" → "Product management or tech consulting" → Clear direction

NARRATIVE ARC:
- Start with "You've been iterating for two weeks. Let's look at the full arc."
- Show complete conversation arcs from vague to precise
- Emphasize each exchange changes ONE thing (Habit 3 🔄 "See what each change does")
- End with "Started vague. Ended precise. That's the power of dialogue."
- Add: "In Trevor's live session, you'll share your own conversation arcs."

IDENTITY SHIFT: "One-shot prompts" → "Iterative dialogue"

FINAL QUESTION: "What's a conversation arc you've had that started vague and ended precise?"
```

**Podcast Title:** "The Conversation Arc"
**Duration:** 8-10 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Podcast Uses Technical Jargon

**Signs:** Mentions "LLM," "neural networks," "training data"

**Fix:** Add to master prompt:
```
CRITICAL: You are FORBIDDEN from using any technical terms including LLM, neural network, training data, parameters, algorithm. If you catch yourself using these, stop and use plain language instead.
```

### Issue 2: Examples Are One-Shot (Not Conversational)

**Signs:** Uses single perfect prompts, doesn't show iteration

**Fix:** Add to master prompt:
```
CRITICAL: You MUST show CONVERSATION ARCS with 2-4 exchanges. NEVER use one-shot prompting examples. Every example must show iteration: start vague → add context → change one thing → arrive at precision.
```

**Add more conversational examples to the node variation.**

**Regenerate.**

---

### Issue 3: Tone Is Lecture-Style, Not Conversational

**Signs:** Hosts sound like they're teaching, not talking

**Fix:** Add to master prompt:
```
TONE CHECK: You are two friends having coffee, NOT professors giving a lecture. Use conversational language ("you know what I mean?", "exactly!", "I hear you"). Interrupt each other naturally. Ask questions. Sound curious, not authoritative.
```

**Regenerate.**

---

### Issue 4: Doesn't Serve Emotional Job (Partnership)

**Signs:** Doesn't make students feel "AI is my thinking partner"

**Fix:** Add to master prompt:
```
EMOTIONAL JOB: Every example must answer "will a student feel like AI is a partner?" Focus on conversational collaboration over one-shot prompting. Show students discovering clarity THROUGH conversation, not getting perfect answers immediately.
```

**Add more "thinking partner" examples to node variation.**

**Regenerate.**

---

### Issue 5: Podcast Is Too Long/Short

**Signs:** Under 8 minutes or over 12 minutes

**Fix:** Adjust in master prompt:
- Too short: Add "Expand each example with more exchanges. Spend 2-3 minutes on each of the 3 examples showing full conversation arcs."
- Too long: Add "Keep examples concise but complete. Move quickly between them. Total duration: 8-10 minutes maximum."

**Regenerate.**

## Success Metrics

### Good Podcast Indicators
- [ ] Trevor listens and thinks "I wish I heard this before I learned to iterate"
- [ ] Feels like it could have been recorded by two thoughtful peers
- [ ] No explanation needed for 17-year-old listeners with 3-4 weeks AI experience
- [ ] Creates partnership identity ("I have a thinking partner")
- [ ] Makes iteration feel natural, not extra work
- [ ] Passes all guardrails checks

### Red Flags
- [ ] Trevor thinks "this sounds like a tech podcast"
- [ ] Needs explanation or background knowledge
- [ ] Sounds like one-shot prompting is better than conversation
- [ ] Uses impressive examples that intimidate
- [ ] Sounds like a lecture or advertisement
- [ ] Fails any guardrails check

**If Red Flags Appear:** Do not use. Adjust prompt and regenerate.

## Notes for Trevor

### Your Role vs. NotebookLM's Role

**NotebookLM (90%):**
- Generates conversational podcasts from source material
- Creates natural dialogue between two hosts
- Handles tone, pacing, examples from instructions

**You (10%):**
- Curate source material
- Write master prompt (this document)
- Review quality against checklist
- Adjust prompt if podcast misses mark
- Final approval before student delivery

**You're not writing podcasts from scratch.** You're guiding NotebookLM with excellent source material and clear instructions.

### Production Timeline

**Per Node Podcast:**
- Source prep: 15 min (one-time for all 4 nodes)
- Upload + configure: 5 min
- Generate + review: 15 min
- Adjustments: 0-2 regenerations × 15 min
- Final export: 5 min

**Total for Zone 2→3 (4 podcasts):** 2-3 hours

**Total for All Zones (16 podcasts):** 8-10 hours

### When to Use These Podcasts

From Epic 2 (Weeks 4-5 Design):
- **Node 2.1:** Week 4, Monday (Day 1) - "Context changes everything"
- **Node 2.2:** Week 4, Wednesday (Day 3) - "AI is a conversation partner"
- **Node 2.3:** Week 5, Monday (Day 1) - "Explaining clarifies MY thinking"
- **Node 2.4:** Week 5, Wednesday (Day 3) - "We're getting closer together"

Students listen asynchronously, then discuss in Discord.
