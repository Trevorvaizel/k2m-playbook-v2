## University Decisions

### University Choice Examples
- UoN vs Strathmore (CS programs): "I'm interested in CS but worried I'm not good enough at math. UoN is larger and more competitive, Strathmore is smaller and more expensive but has good placement."
- Public vs Private: "Choosing between public university (affordable, large classes) and private university (expensive, smaller community, more personal attention)"
- Competitive vs Safe: "Should I apply to competitive 'reach' universities or play it safe with 'match' schools where I'm confident I'll get in?"
- Campus Culture: "I want a university with strong campus community. I don't want to be just a number at a huge school."
- Program Focus: "I'm interested in CS generally, but I want to focus on AI and machine learning specifically. How do different programs compare for that specialization?"

### Application Examples
- Essay Anxiety: "I'm stressed about writing my university application essays. I don't know how to stand out without sounding fake."
- Recommendation Letters: "I need to ask teachers for recommendation letters but I'm shy and haven't been very active in class."
- Multiple Acceptances: "I got accepted to three universities. I'm having trouble deciding between them because each has different strengths."

## Career Exploration

### Field Comparison Examples
- Software Engineering vs Data Science: "I love both coding and statistics. SE is more about building systems, DS is more about extracting insights. Which fits my personality better?"
- Passion vs Practicality: "My parents want me to pursue nursing (stable, respected) but I'm excited about graphic design (creative, less stable). How do I decide?"
- Healthcare Careers: "I think I want to work in healthcare but I'm not sure if I should be a doctor, nurse, or public health researcher."

### Career Discovery Examples
- /diverge for Exploration: "/diverge I think I want to work in healthcare but I'm not sure if I should be a doctor, nurse, or public health researcher. Help me see different angles."
- Strengths Assessment: "I'm good at math and I like helping people, but I don't want to work directly with patients. What healthcare careers fit that?"
- Industry Research: "/diverge I'm considering a career in tech but I don't know if I should be a developer, product manager, or data analyst. Help me explore."

### Decision-Making Examples
- /challenge for Testing: "/challenge I've decided to pursue computer science. Here's my reasoning: I love coding and it pays well. Help me see what I'm missing."
- Values Clarification: "I'm choosing between a high-paying job I'm less interested in vs. a lower-paying job I'm passionate about. How do I weigh this?"
- Long-Term Thinking: "I want a career that will still be relevant in 10 years. How do I future-proof my career choice?"

## Study Decisions

### Exam Preparation Examples

- Subject-Specific: "I'm studying for my physics exam and I keep confusing the concepts of voltage and current. Can you help me understand the difference?"
- Time Management: "I have 2 weeks until exams and I need to study for 5 subjects. I feel like I don't have enough time."

### Understanding Complex Topics Examples
- Physics: "Explain electricity using real-world examples for a visual learner preparing for physics exam"
- Chemistry: "Help me understand organic chemistry. I'm burned out from studying and the abstract concepts aren't sticking."
- Math: "I don't understand calculus. I can do the problems but I don't get WHAT I'm actually solving or WHY it works."
- Abstract Concepts: "What is the difference between climate change and weather? I hear these terms but I'm confused about the distinction."

### Study Strategies Examples
- Active Learning: "I've been studying by reading my notes but I feel like I'm not retaining information. What else can I do?"
- Procrastination: "I keep procrastinating on studying. I know I should start but I can't make myself do it."

## Using CIS Agents with Examples

### /frame Examples

- Decision Framing: "/frame I'm trying to decide between university and taking a gap year. Here's what I know: I'm burned out from Form 6, I'm worried about losing momentum, my parents want me to continue. Here's what I'm confused about: Will a gap year hurt my long-term prospects?"
- Self-Understanding: "/frame I'm trying to understand my career interests. Here's what I know: I like math, I enjoy helping people, I'm shy. Here's what's confused about: What careers actually fit all of these?"

## Student Example Crowdsourcing (Cohort 1)

**How Students Contribute:**

### Friday Reflection Bonus Prompt (Week 4 & 5)
```
🌟 BONUS (Optional): Share an Example

Want to help future students?

Share ONE specific example from your Week 4/5 practice:
- Your actual question (university, career, study, etc.)
- How you added context
- How you iterated
- What you learned

We'll feature the best examples in next cohort's content!

[Optional - No pressure if you don't have time]
```

### Example Curation Process
1. Agent collects student examples from Friday reflections
2. Trevor reviews during Friday spot-check (10% role)
3. Best examples tagged for inclusion in example library
4. Update library quarterly based on real student submissions

### Student Example Hall of Fame
Week 8 showcase will include "Community Examples" section recognizing students whose examples helped others.

---

## Example Rotation System (Future Enhancement)

### For Epic 3 or Cohort 2:

**Week 1-2:** Use curated pre-written examples from library (this document)
**Week 3-4:** Introduce student-submitted examples from Cohort 1
**Week 5+:** Mix of curated + student examples (70/30 split)

**Principle:** Start safe (curated), build community (student contributions)

## Quality Guidelines for Examples

### ✅ Good Examples Are:
- **Specific** - Not "help me study" but "I'm studying for physics exam and confused about voltage vs. current"
- **Relatable** - Reflect real pre-university concerns (anxiety, parents, money, identity)
- **Diverse** - Cover university, career, study, and personal growth domains
- **Emotionally Honest** - Acknowledge anxiety, confusion, pressure, burnout

### ❌ Bad Examples Are:
- **Generic** - "Help me with [task]" without context
- **Adult Concerns** - Retirement planning, mortgage decisions, parenting
- **Irrelevant** - Pet poems, random jokes, silly scenarios
- **Inauthentic** - Sound too perfect or polished

**Version:** 1.0 (Cohort 1 launch)
**Next Review:** Week 5 (mid-cohort) - Add student examples
**Owner:** Trevor Omboga (Content Lead)
**Purpose:** Living document that improves with each cohort
