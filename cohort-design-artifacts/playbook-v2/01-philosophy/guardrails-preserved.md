# Story 1.1: Core Guardrails - Preserved & Enhanced for v2

**Epic:** 1 - Philosophy & Framework
**Story:** 1.1 - Review and preserve core guardrails from v1
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Created:** 2026-01-22
**Purpose:** Foundation layer - Load-bearing walls that protect framework purity, student safety, and scalability

---

## v1 → v2 GUARDRAIL INVENTORY

All guardrails from v1 have been reviewed. **Status: ALL PRESERVED** with annotations for v2 context.

---

## GUARDRAIL #1: WHAT THIS COHORT ACTUALLY IS

**Purpose:** Identity Protection - Prevents scope creep and mission drift
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Enhanced with JTBD language

### We are NOT:
- Teaching AI tools or prompts
- Certifying technical skills
- Creating portfolio projects
- Teaching "advanced" AI systems
- A traditional course

### We ARE:
- Moving learners through **perceptual zones** (Zone 0 → early Zone 4)
- Installing **durable thinking habits**
- Creating **identity shifts** ("AI is not for me" → "I work with AI intentionally")
- Designing for **psychological safety**, not performance
- Building **confidence that transfers** to university and SME contexts

**v2 Enhancement - JTBD Translation:**
- **Functional Job:** "Help me move from confusion to clarity in AI before university starts"
- **Emotional Job:** "Help me stop feeling anxious and start feeling like I belong"
- **Social Job:** "Give me proof I can show to myself, my parents, and my future"

**v2 Context:** Agent-facilitated model (90/10 hybrid) preserves these principles better than human facilitators (no advice-giving drift).

---

## GUARDRAIL #2: THE ZONE PROGRESSION FRAMEWORK

**Purpose:** Structural Foundation - The core mental model of the entire program
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Now serves as identity shift map

### The Zone Progression (Internal Framework)

**Zone 0:** "AI is not for me / it's sci-fi"
→ **Zone 1:** "AI is something I could use"
→ **Zone 2:** "AI does tasks for me"
→ **Zone 3:** "AI understands my intent / I collaborate with it"
→ **Zone 4:** "I control quality / I direct AI"

**Our Target (6 Weeks):** Zone 0 → early Zone 4

**v2 Enhancement - Node Integration:**
Each zone transition now has **specific nodes** (Decision 10) that install the identity shift:
- **Zone 0→1 (Wonder)**: 4 nodes (witnessing → relatability → permission → fun)
- **Zone 1→2 (Trust)**: 4 nodes (contrast → wins → safety → habit)
- **Zone 2→3 (Converse)**: 4 nodes (context → conversation → meta-awareness → refinement)
- **Zone 3→4 (Direct)**: 4 nodes (iteration → ownership → skill → director identity)

**v2 Context:** Valid outcome is Zone 2-3 (Decision 4) - Journey A completion is a success.

---

## GUARDRAIL #3: DESIGN GUARDRAILS (NEVER DO)

**Purpose:** Safety Rails - Prevents intimidation, comparison, and performance anxiety
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Critical for agent-facilitated model

### We NEVER:
1. **Use technical jargon in Week 1**
   - *Why:* Zone 0 students are scared of " sounding stupid"
   - *v2 Context:* Agent prompts must follow this - no tech-heavy language in Week 1 node content

2. **Show "impressive" AI outputs**
   - *Why:* Creates intimidation, "I could never do that"
   - *v2 Context:* NotebookLM podcasts and node examples must show RELATABLE outputs, not impressive ones

3. **Compare students or rank outputs**
   - *Why:* Destroys psychological safety
   - *v2 Context:* Agent must NEVER surface comparisons like "top 3 reflections" - only aggregate visibility

4. **Praise speed or "correctness"**
   - *Why:* Rewards performance, encourages rushing
   - *v2 Context:* Agent feedback should celebrate thinking, not speed/accuracy

5. **Talk about "building," "automation," or "systems"**
   - *Why:* Premature for Zone 0-2, sounds like work/business
   - *v2 Context:* Save these terms for Zone 3-4 only

6. **Evaluate or grade artifacts**
   - *Why:* Shifts focus to external validation
   - *v2 Context:* Self-assessment with proof-of-work (Decision 5) - no agent grading

**v2 Context - Agent Behavior:**
All automated interventions must respect these NEVER rules. This is **framework purity protection** - the reason we chose agent-facilitated model (Decision 1).

---

## GUARDRAIL #4: DESIGN GUARDRAILS (ALWAYS DO)

**Purpose:** Quality Standards - Ensures consistent student experience
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Core principles for node design and agent interactions

### We ALWAYS:
1. **Prioritize clarity over cleverness**
   - *v2 Application:* Node content, agent prompts, daily prompts - all must be crystal clear

2. **Prioritize confidence over competence**
   - *v2 Application:* Celebrate small wins, normalize confusion, build momentum

3. **Normalize confusion ("this is normal")**
   - *v2 Application:* Agent responses should use "many students feel..." language

4. **Use repetition over novelty**
   - *v2 Application:* The 4 Habits appear in every node, session, prompt - reinforcement, not variety

5. **Create psychological safety**
   - *v2 Application:* Private CIS conversations, no public shaming, escalation paths for stuck students

6. **Frame AI as responding to thinking, not intelligence**
   - *v2 Application:* Every node should emphasize "better thinking → better AI responses"

**v2 Context - The 4 Habits:**
These ALWAYS principles operationalize the 4 Core Habits (detailed in Story 1.4).

---

## GUARDRAIL #5: THE 4 CORE HABITS

**Purpose:** Value Proposition - The tangible outcome students "buy"
**v2 Status:** ✅ PRESERVED - Will be branded in Story 1.4 as graduation-proof markers

### By Week 6, students will have these habits:

1. **Pause before asking** → "What do I actually want?"
2. **Explain context first** → "Here's my situation..."
3. **Change one thing at a time** → "What does this affect?"
4. **Use AI before decisions** → "Help me think, not just answer"

**If they keep these habits, the cohort succeeded. Tools change, habits transfer.**

**v2 Enhancement (see Story 1.4):**
- These habits become **graduation artifacts** - visible, tangible proof
- Aligned with **Dual Pillars** (Decision 17):
  - Habits 1 & 2 = Democratized Intelligence (better thinking)
  - Habits 3 & 4 = Democratized Expertise (better knowledge access)
- Mapped to **JTBD Social Job**: "Give me proof I can show to myself, my parents, and my future"

---

## v2-SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS (NEW)

These emerge from v2 decisions and extend v1 principles:

### Guardrail #6: Agent-Facilitated Model Purity

**Purpose:** Prevents "human-ness" drift that breaks framework

**Agent Capabilities (90%):**
- All mechanical tasks (prompts, tracking, nudges, reactions)
- All template interventions
- All gating/progression
- Peer visibility aggregation (without comparison/ranking)
- CIS agent conversations (/frame, /diverge, /challenge, /synthesize)

**Trevor Capabilities (10%):**
- Friday spot-check: 15-20 student reflections
- 1-hour live sessions (alternating days per cluster)
- Escalations: Agent flags students stuck 3+ days
- Culture monitoring: Are norms being followed?

**Protective Rule:** Agents must NEVER give advice, opinions, or personalized guidance outside of structured CIS roles. This prevents the advice-giving drift that human facilitators inevitably show.

---

### Guardrail #7: Zone Node Content Quality

**Purpose:** Ensures node-based learning delivers identity shifts

**Every Node Must:**
1. **Target a specific zone transition** (0→1, 1→2, 2→3, or 3→4)
2. **Address one emotional job** (belonging, confidence, clarity, ownership)
3. **Model one 4 Habit** (pause, explain, change, use before deciding)
4. **Be NotebookLM-compatible** (can be delivered as conversational podcast)
5. **Pass the "So what?" test** - Student should feel "This is about ME, not AI"

**Quality Checklist (for Story 2.6):**
- [ ] Zone transition explicit?
- [ ] Emotional job targeted?
- [ ] 4 Habit reinforced?
- [ ] Identity shift visible?
- [ ] Example is relatable, not impressive?

---

### Guardrail #8: Discord Hybrid Model Safety

**Purpose:** Balances private process with public celebration

**Architecture (Decision 12):**
```
#thinking-lab (instructions + entry point)
    ↓
Private DM/Thread (CIS agent interactions)
    ↓ (safe, messy thinking documented)
    ↓
#thinking-showcase (finished artifacts celebrated)
```

**Safety Rules:**
- Process is **private** (students can be messy without judgment)
- Product is **public** (peer learning from finished thinking)
- Journey is **documented** (thread becomes evidence of growth)
- Celebration is **visible** (social proof, motivation)

**Protective Rule:** Never push students to share incomplete thinking. Only showcase-ready artifacts go public.

---

### Guardrail #9: Thinking Artifact Authenticity

**Purpose:** Ensures artifact proves identity transformation, not AI usage

**Artifact Structure (Decision 13):**
```
THE QUESTION I WRESTLED WITH: [Student's chosen question]
HOW I REFRAMED IT: [Using /frame with The Framer]
WHAT I EXPLORED: [Using /diverge with The Explorer]
WHAT I CHALLENGED: [Using /challenge with The Challenger]
WHAT I CONCLUDED: [Using /synthesize with The Synthesizer]
WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME: [Reflection on thinking growth]
```

**Authenticity Check:**
- Does this show **their thinking**, not AI's output?
- Can they **explain their choices** when asked?
- Would this artifact **convince a parent** that transformation happened?

**Guardrail:** No templates, no fill-in-the-blanks. Each artifact must be unique to the student's thinking journey.

---

### Guardrail #10: Brand Voice & Altitude Compliance

**Purpose:** Ensures all content respects the "Thinking WITH AI" positioning and JTBD altitude system

**From Brand Framework v3 (Decision 17):**

**Core Brand Positioning:**
- **"Think WITH AI, not copy FROM it"** - This is the non-negotiable positioning statement
- **NOT:** "Learn to use AI tools" / "Master ChatGPT" / "Prompt engineering"
- **IS:** "Build thinking habits" / "Mental models for AI" / "Think in the AI age"

**The Dual Pillars:**
- **Pillar 1: Democratized Intelligence** - AI makes powerful thinking available to everyone
- **Pillar 2: Democratized Expertise** - AI collapses knowledge gaps across domains
- **The Unifying Skill:** Thinking WITH AI unlocks BOTH pillars

**JTBD Altitude System (Layer -1):**

**Level 1 (Ground - Immediate Concrete):**
- **Target:** Cold students
- **Language:** "You've done it: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V" / "Sometimes AI works, sometimes it doesn't"
- **Emotion:** Recognition ("I feel this")
- **Use:** Hooks, first-touch content

**Level 2 (Pattern - Observable Truth):**
- **Target:** Warm students, parents
- **Language:** "Copy-pasters get stuck. Thinkers thrive." / "The habits you form now follow you forever"
- **Emotion:** Pattern recognition
- **Use:** Student body copy, parent awareness

**Level 3 (Framework - System/Structure):**
- **Target:** Parents, principals, engaged students
- **Language:** "Mental models for WHEN/HOW/WHY to use AI" / "The cohort structure keeps them accountable"
- **Emotion:** Curiosity about the system
- **Use:** Method content, parent conversion

**Level 4 (Transformation - What Becomes Possible):**
- **Target:** Principals, warm audiences
- **Language:** "Students learn to think WITH AI, not just copy FROM it" / "Skills that compound across career"
- **Emotion:** Aspiration to transformation
- **Use:** Principal pitches, vision content

**Level 5 (Philosophy - Timeless Principle):**
- **Target:** Believers, manifesto audience, internal alignment
- **Language:** "AI is the democratization of expertise" / "Extension of consciousness"
- **Emotion:** Wonder, mission-alignment
- **Use:** Brand manifesto, fellow educators, AFTER someone is already bought in

**Brand Voice Rules:**

1. **Revolutionary Hope Tone** (60% hope + empowerment, 30% justice + access, 10% wonder + discovery)
   - Linguistic DNA: "Finally" / "Wield" / "Achieve more" / "Extension of"
   - AVOID: Fear-based urgency, scarcity tactics, manipulation
   - **Altitude translation:** Hope must feel attainable, not abstract
     - Level 1: "Stop feeling confused when you use AI"
     - Level 2: "The habits that follow you forever"
     - Level 5: "Wield intelligence like experts"

2. **Emotional Core:** Hope + Empowerment (NOT fear or pressure)
   - Aspiration-driven, not anxiety-driven
   - "When you're ready, we're here" (invitational, not aggressive)

3. **Coined Terms (Brand IP) - Must Use Correctly:**
   - "Mental models for WHEN/HOW/WHY to use AI" - Use at Level 2-3, not Level 1
   - "Think WITH AI, not copy FROM it" - Universal, works at all levels
   - "Strategic AI integration" - Level 2-4 only
   - "Extension of consciousness" - Level 5 ONLY (manifesto content)
   - "Democratization of expertise" - Level 5 internally, translate to "Give your child what Nairobi kids have" for parents

4. **The Golden Rule:** START LOW, END HIGH
   - Touch 1 → Level 1-2 (Concrete/Pattern)
   - Touch 2 → Level 2-3 (Pattern/Framework)
   - Touch 3 → Level 3-4 (Framework/Transform)
   - Touch 4 → Level 4-5 (Transform/Philosophy)
   - **EARN the right to go higher**

**Voice Filter Checklist:**
- [ ] Does this sound like K2M? (Revolutionary Hope tone)
- [ ] Uses at least ONE coined term correctly
- [ ] Balances rigor + empathy
- [ ] Empowers rather than fear-mongers
- [ ] Aligns with democratization mission
- [ ] **NEW:** Matches JTBD altitude for target persona
- [ ] **NEW:** Would target persona say "I can't unsee it"?

**Guardrail:** Every piece of content—student-facing, parent-facing, principal-facing, internal—MUST:
1. Reinforce "Think WITH AI" positioning (not "use AI tools")
2. Match the JTBD altitude of the target audience
3. Use Revolutionary Hope tone (hope + empowerment, not fear)
4. Earn higher altitudes through multiple touches

**V3 Integration Reference:** See `_bmad-output/k2m-edtech-brand-artifacts/k2m-brand-conversion-framework-v3.md` for complete brand framework including Layer -2 (Core Concept), Layer -1 (JTBD Altitude), and Layer 0 (Voice Signature).

### Guardrail #11: JTBD-Relevant Examples

**Purpose:** Ensures all examples match the audience's actual life context and serve real jobs-to-be-done

**The Problem This Solves:** Generic or juvenile examples (cat poems, silly nicknames) don't serve the emotional job of pre-university students who are anxious about their futures. Examples must feel relevant to their life transition.

**Rule:** Every node example must pass the "Would this matter to them?" test:
1. Does this example address a real concern in their life transition?
2. Would they see themselves in this scenario?
3. Could they explain to their parents why this matters?
4. Does it serve functional, emotional, OR social JTBD?

**For Pre-University Students (Primary Audience - Cohort 1):**

**Their Life Context:**
- Transitioning from high school to university
- Anxious about academic performance and career direction
- Want to prove themselves to parents
- Need skills that transfer to "real" situations

**APPROVED Example Categories:**
- ✅ University applications, essay brainstorming, course selection
- ✅ Study techniques, exam preparation, understanding complex topics
- ✅ Career exploration, internship questions, CV thinking
- ✅ Decision-making about their future
- ✅ Understanding topics they'll encounter in university
- ✅ Processing anxiety about transitions

**PROHIBITED Example Categories:**
- ❌ Pet poems, random jokes, silly scenarios
- ❌ Trivial games that don't connect to their concerns
- ❌ Examples that feel "middle school" level
- ❌ Anything a parent would see as "wasting time"

**Scaling Consideration (Future Audiences):**

When expanding to other audiences, examples MUST flex to their life contexts while node CONCEPTS stay constant:

| Audience | Life Context | Example Categories |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Pre-University | University transition, career anxiety | Applications, study, career exploration |
| University Students | Academic pressure, internships | Research, projects, professional skills |
| Early-Career Professionals | Job performance, career growth | Work tasks, presentations, skill development |
| Corporate Teams | Productivity, collaboration | Meeting prep, project work, communication |

**The Principle:** Fun comes from RELEVANCE, not silliness. A pre-university student finds it "fun" when AI helps them explore careers they're genuinely curious about - not when it writes cat poems.

**Implementation:** Node STRUCTURE stays constant across audiences. Example SETS are swapped based on target segment. NotebookLM master prompts (Epic 3) must include audience-specific example libraries.
