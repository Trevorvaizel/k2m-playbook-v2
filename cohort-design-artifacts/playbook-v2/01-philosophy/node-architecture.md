# Story 1.3: Node-Based Learning Architecture

**Epic:** 1 - Philosophy & Framework
**Story:** 1.3 - Document node-based learning architecture
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Created:** 2026-01-22
**Purpose:** Structural layer - Documents the lattice framework, node design principles, and how nodes accumulate into identity shifts

---

## THE CORE CONCEPT: MENTAL LATTICE

**From Cartographer's Manifesto:** Learning isn't linear (A→B→C). It's a **lattice** - interconnected concepts that form a mental structure students can climb through.

**Decision 10 (Node-Based Architecture):** Mental lattice filled by specific nodes at each zone/shift.

**Visual Metaphor:** Think of it like rock climbing:
- **The wall** = The AI territory map (zones 0-4)
- **The holds** = Nodes (specific concepts, experiences, insights)
- **The route** = Each student's unique journey through the lattice
- **The summit** = Zone 4 (director identity)

---

## WHAT IS A NODE?

**Definition:** A node is a **discrete learning unit** that:
1. Targets a specific zone transition (0→1, 1→2, 2→3, or 3→4)
2. Addresses one emotional job (belonging, confidence, clarity, ownership)
3. Reinforces one 4 Habit (pause, explain, change, use before deciding)
4. Creates a micro-identity shift ("I am someone who...")
5. Can be delivered via NotebookLM as a conversational podcast

**What a Node is NOT:**
- ❌ A tutorial on how to use a tool
- ❌ A feature showcase ("Look what AI can do!")
- ❌ A list of tips or tricks
- ❌ Technical documentation

**What a Node IS:**
- ✅ A perspective shift ("Oh, that's how to think about this")
- ✅ An emotional experience ("I feel more confident now")
- ✅ A habit installation ("I should pause before asking")
- ✅ An identity nudge ("I'm someone who can do this")

## NODE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: One Node, One Shift
**What this means:** Each node targets ONE specific identity shift.

**How to apply:**
- Start with identity shift: "I want them to feel X"
- Work backward to concept that creates that feeling
- Test: "Does this node make them feel X? If not, revise"

**Bad node:** "How to use ChatGPT for homework" (too many shifts, skills-focused)
**Good node:** "AI responds to YOUR situation" (single shift: context awareness)

---

### Principle 2: Concrete Experience, Not Abstract Concept
**What this means:** Nodes must be experiential, not informational.

**How to apply:**
- Use "try this" examples, not "here's a principle"
- Show specific before/after comparisons
- Use relatable scenarios (homework, friends, hobbies)

**Bad node:** "The importance of context in AI prompting" (abstract)
**Good node:** "Watch how this AI response changes when we add context" (experiential)

---

### Principle 3: Relatable, Not Impressive
**What this means:** Node examples should feel attainable, not intimidating.

**How to apply:**
- Avoid "look at this amazing thing AI did" examples
- Use "here's something normal you can do" examples
- Celebrate clarity over cleverness

**Bad node:** "AI generated this incredible business plan" (impressive, intimidating)
**Good node:** "AI helped me think through which college to pick" (relatable, helpful)

---

### Principle 4: NotebookLM-Compatible
**What this means:** Every node can be delivered as a conversational podcast.

**How to apply:**
- Frame as dialogue between two voices
- Use conversational tone ("you know what I mean?")
- Include storytelling hooks, personal anecdotes

**Bad node:** Bullet list of tips (doesn't work as podcast)
**Good node:** "Let me tell you about the time I realized..." (podcast-friendly)

---

### Principle 5: Habit-Reinforcing
**What this means:** Every node reinforces one of the 4 Habits.

**How to apply:**
- **Zone 0-1 nodes:** Reinforce Habit 1 (Pause before asking)
- **Zone 1-2 nodes:** Reinforce Habit 2 (Explain context first)
- **Zone 2-3 nodes:** Reinforce Habit 3 (Change one thing at a time)
- **Zone 3-4 nodes:** Reinforce Habit 4 (Use AI before decisions)

**Test:** "After experiencing this node, will they be more likely to use [Habit]?"

## AUDIENCE-APPROPRIATE EXAMPLE FRAMEWORK (Guardrail #11)

**Core Principle:** Node STRUCTURE stays constant across audiences. Example SETS flex based on target segment.

### Why This Matters

The same node concept ("It's actually fun") means different things to different audiences:
- **Pre-university student:** "Fun" = exploring careers, understanding their future, reducing anxiety
- **Corporate employee:** "Fun" = solving a work problem, impressing their team, learning something useful
- **Early-career professional:** "Fun" = advancing their career, building skills, standing out

Generic examples (cat poems, silly scenarios) don't serve ANY audience's real jobs-to-be-done.

### Example Sets by Audience

#### Pre-University Students (Primary - Cohort 1)

**Their JTBD:**
- Functional: "Help me move from confusion to clarity before university"
- Emotional: "Help me stop feeling anxious and start feeling like I belong"
- Social: "Give me proof I can show to myself, my parents, and my future"

**Example Categories:**
| Node | Generic (WRONG) | JTBD-Aligned (RIGHT) |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 0.1 "AI is here" | "Netflix recommendations" | "Study apps you use, career websites" |
| 0.2 "People like me" | "Random adults" | "Students applying to university, Form 4 leavers" |
| 0.3 "I could try" | "Cat jokes, toast recipes" | "Understand a topic, explore a career" |
| 0.4 "It's engaging" | "Cat poems, nicknames" | "Career exploration, essay brainstorming, processing anxiety" |

#### University Students (Future Expansion)

**Their JTBD:**
- Functional: "Help me succeed academically and prepare for internships"
- Emotional: "Help me feel capable despite imposter syndrome"
- Social: "Help me stand out to employers and peers"

**Example Categories:**
| Node | Example Focus |
|------|---------------|
| 0.1 "AI is here" | Research tools, citation helpers, academic writing aids |
| 0.2 "People like me" | Students in their major, successful interns |
| 0.3 "I could try" | Summarize a paper, outline a project, prep for interview |
| 0.4 "It's engaging" | Research brainstorming, thesis exploration, internship applications |

#### Early-Career Professionals (Future Expansion)

**Their JTBD:**
- Functional: "Help me perform better at work and grow my career"
- Emotional: "Help me feel confident in meetings and with leadership"
- Social: "Help me be seen as capable and forward-thinking"

**Example Categories:**
| Node | Example Focus |
|------|---------------|
| 0.1 "AI is here" | Work tools, email assistants, meeting summaries |
| 0.2 "People like me" | Professionals in their field, people at their level |
| 0.3 "I could try" | Draft an email, prep for a meeting, understand a report |
| 0.4 "It's engaging" | Presentation brainstorming, skill development, problem-solving |

#### Corporate Teams (Future Expansion)

**Their JTBD:**
- Functional: "Help us work more efficiently as a team"
- Emotional: "Help us feel capable of adapting to change"
- Social: "Help us demonstrate value to leadership"

**Example Categories:**
| Node | Example Focus |
|------|---------------|
| 0.1 "AI is here" | Team tools, project management AI, collaboration aids |
| 0.2 "People like me" | Teams in similar industries, competitor companies |
| 0.3 "I could try" | Summarize meeting notes, draft project brief, analyze data |
| 0.4 "It's engaging" | Strategic brainstorming, innovation sessions, team problem-solving |

### Implementation for NotebookLM Prompts (Epic 3)

When creating NotebookLM master prompts, include:
1. **Audience identifier** - Which segment is this for?
2. **Example library** - Segment-specific scenarios only
3. **JTBD reference** - Which job does each example serve?
4. **Anti-examples** - What NOT to include (generic/juvenile examples)

## NODE CONTENT CHECKLIST (For Story 2.6)

Every node must pass these checks before inclusion:

### Zone Transition Check
- [ ] Zone transition is explicit (0→1, 1→2, 2→3, or 3→4)
- [ ] Identity shift is clear ("From X to Y")
- [ ] Connects to previous zone's nodes

### Emotional Job Check
- [ ] Which emotional job does this serve? (belonging, confidence, companionship, ownership)
- [ ] Will students feel [emotion] after experiencing this node?
- [ ] Is the emotional experience authentic, not forced?

### 4 Habits Check
- [ ] Which habit does this reinforce? (pause, explain, change, use before deciding)
- [ ] Does the node SHOW the habit in action, not just tell?
- [ ] Will students be more likely to use this habit after?

### Example Quality Check
- [ ] Example is relatable (student's actual life)
- [ ] Example is not impressive (avoids intimidation)
- [ ] Example is concrete (specific scenario, not abstract concept)

### NotebookLM Compatibility Check
- [ ] Can this work as a conversational podcast?
- [ ] Is the tone conversational, not lecture-style?
- [ ] Are there storytelling hooks or anecdotes?

### Identity Shift Check
- [ ] After this node, can student say "I'm someone who..."?
- [ ] Is the shift specific, not generic?
- [ ] Does the shift feel earned, not declared?

### JTBD Relevance Check (Guardrail #11)
- [ ] Does this example address a REAL concern in their life transition?
- [ ] Would a parent say "Yes, that's valuable for my child"?
- [ ] Does the example serve functional, emotional, OR social job?
- [ ] Is the example age-appropriate AND life-stage appropriate?
- [ ] Could this example be used in a conversation with a university interviewer?
- [ ] Is this example from the APPROVED categories for this audience segment?
- [ ] Does this AVOID the PROHIBITED categories (cat poems, silly scenarios, juvenile games)?

## NOTEBOOKLM PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### For Epic 3 (Session Scripts & Content):

**Step 1: Master Prompt Creation (Stories 3.2-3.5)**
- Create zone-specific master prompts
- Include: tone, perspective, examples to avoid, examples to include
- Specify: conversational style, two-host dialogue format

**Step 2: Source Material Preparation**
- Gather Cartographer's Manifesto zone descriptions
- Include JTBD emotional job for the zone
- Add relevant 4 Habit reinforcement
- List example scenarios (relatable, not impressive)

**Step 3: NotebookLM Generation**
- Upload source material to NotebookLM
- Use master prompt as "instructions to hosts"
- Generate 8-12 minute podcast per node
- Review for guardrails compliance (no jargon, no impressive examples)

**Step 4: Quality Review**

- Is the identity shift clear?
- Is the 4 Habit visible?
- Would this intimidate a Zone 0 student?

**Step 5: Student Delivery**
- Upload to Discord #thinking-lab
- Schedule for specific day (see Epic 2 weekly designs)
- Include reflection prompt: "What did YOU notice about YOUR thinking?"

---

## NODE ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

**Total Nodes:** 16 (4 per zone transition)
**Zone Coverage:** 0→1, 1→2, 2→3, 3→4
**Identity Arc:** Outsider → Observer → Experimenter → Collaborator → Director
**Delivery Method:** NotebookLM podcasts (8-12 min each)
**Total Audio Content:** ~3 hours across 6 weeks

**Architecture Principles:**
- ✅ One node, one identity shift
- ✅ Concrete experience, not abstract concept
- ✅ Relatable examples, not impressive demos
- ✅ NotebookLM-compatible delivery
- ✅ 4 Habits reinforcement in every node
- ✅ Zone progression through lattice accumulation

**Key Insight:** Nodes aren't content chunks - they're **identity touchpoints** that gradually transform how students see themselves in relation to AI.

## BRAND LANGUAGE EXAMPLES PER NODE (From Brand Framework v3)

Each node should use altitude-appropriate language from the Brand Framework v3.

### Zone 0→1 Nodes (Wonder) - Use Level 1-2 Language

**Node 0.1 "AI is not sci-fi":**
- Level 1 hook: "You've been using AI for years without knowing it"
- Level 2 pattern: "Spotify playlists. Netflix recommendations. These are AI you already use"

**Node 0.2 "People like me use this":**
- Level 1 hook: "Students like you. Parents like yours. Already using AI"
- Level 2 pattern: "AI isn't just for tech people. It's for everyone"

**Node 0.3 "I could try this":**
- Level 1 hook: "Try asking AI for a joke. Or a recipe. Nothing scary"
- Level 2 pattern: "Start small. No pressure. See what happens"

**Node 0.4 "It's actually fun":**
- Level 1 hook: "AI wrote a poem about my cat"
- Level 2 pattern: "Play first. Serious learning comes later"

### Zone 1→2 Nodes (Trust) - Use Level 2 Language

**Node 1.1 "It works for MY tasks":**
- Level 2: "See how AI responds when you explain YOUR situation"

**Node 1.2 "Wins accumulate":**
- Level 2: "Small wins add up. You're building momentum"

**Node 1.3 "Errors are recoverable":**
- Level 2: "Mistakes aren't failures. They're learning steps"

**Node 1.4 "Habit formation":**
- Level 2: "You just reached for AI automatically. That's a habit"

### Zone 2→3 Nodes (Converse) - Use Level 2-3 Language

**Node 2.1 "Context changes everything":**
- Level 2: "Watch what happens when you add context"
- Level 3: "AI responds to YOUR specific situation"

**Node 2.2 "AI is conversation":**
- Level 2: "Don't just prompt—talk back"
- Level 3: "AI becomes your thinking partner"

**Node 2.3 "Explaining clarifies":**
- Level 2: "When you explain to AI, you understand better"
- Level 3: "Explaining clarifies YOUR thinking"

**Node 2.4 "Iterative refinement":**
- Level 2: "Each exchange sharpens your understanding"
- Level 3: "Conversation refines toward precision"

### Zone 3→4 Nodes (Direct) - Use Level 3-4 Language

**Node 3.1 "First draft is raw material":**
- Level 3: "AI generates → You refine"
- Level 4: "You're the director. AI provides raw material"

**Node 3.2 "I have opinions":**
- Level 3: "You're developing taste"
- Level 4: "You now have standards for quality"

**Node 3.3 "Direction techniques":**
- Level 3: "Learn to steer AI toward what you want"
- Level 4: "Directing AI is a skill you now have"

**Node 3.4 "I made this":**
- Level 3: "From AI draft to your voice"
- Level 4: "You're the author. AI assisted"

**Key Rule:** Never use Level 5 language ("democratization," "consciousness extension") in node content. Save for manifesto-level philosophy.

**V3 Framework Reference:** See `_bmad-output/k2m-edtech-brand-artifacts/k2m-brand-conversion-framework-v3.md` for complete altitude system, revolutionary hope tone, and coined terms usage.
