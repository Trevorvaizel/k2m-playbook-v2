# Story 2.4: Weeks 6-7 (Direct) - Complete Design + Nodes + Artifact Start

**Epic:** 2 - 8-Week Design & Zone Nodes
**Story:** 2.4 - Define Weeks 6-7 (Direct) complete design + nodes + artifact start
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Production Ready:** YES - Goes directly to students

---

## Weeks 6-7 Overview: From Partner to Director

**Zone Shift:** Zone 3 → Zone 4
**From:** "AI is a thinking partner I collaborate with"
**To:** "AI is a tool I direct intentionally toward outcomes"

**Identity Shift:** Collaborator → Director
**Emotional Job:** Capability ("I can make things happen")
**4 Habits Focus:** Habit 4 - Use AI Before Decisions 🧠
**CIS Agents:** Full suite + /synthesize introduced (/frame, /diverge, /challenge, /synthesize)

**Weeks Promise:** "By the end of these weeks, you'll move from collaborating with AI to directing it intentionally. You'll have the confidence to say 'I made this' about work you created WITH AI. And you'll begin your artifact - proof that you think WITH AI."

**Public Promise (to students):** "Over the next two weeks, you'll discover that AI isn't just a conversation partner - it's raw material for your vision. You'll learn to direct AI intentionally, shape outcomes to match your standards, and create work you're proud to call your own. You're becoming someone who directs AI toward what matters."

**8-Week Program Context:**
- Week 1: Wonder (Zone 0→1) - ✅ COMPLETE
- Weeks 2-3: Trust (Zone 1→2) - ✅ COMPLETE
- Weeks 4-5: Converse (Zone 2→3) - ✅ COMPLETE
- **Weeks 6-7: Direct (Zone 3→4) + Artifact start - You are here**
- Week 8: Artifact completion + Showcase

**Why 2 Weeks for Direct?**

Direction and ownership build through **creation and refinement**. Two weeks allows for:
- Direction techniques to become intuitive (not just theoretical)
- Ownership identity to form ("I have standards about quality")
- Artifact creation to be meaningful (not rushed)
- Director identity to stabilize ("I made this")

Week 6 establishes "I can direct AI." Week 7 cements "I create with intention."

### Monday (Week 6): "First Drafts Are Raw Material"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Node 3.1** (NotebookLM podcast: "First Drafts Are Raw Material")
- Duration: 8-12 minutes
- Format: Conversational podcast between two hosts
- Delivery: Discord #thinking-lab

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Shape the Raw Material

For five weeks, you've been collaborating with AI.
Here's the mindset shift: AI's first output is raw material, not final product.

Today's insight: You can direct AI to shape outcomes to match your vision.

Task: Ask AI to help with something real - then actively direct it.

**Example: Writing Your Personal Statement**

Step 1: Start with context (Habit 2 🎯)
"I need to write a personal statement for university applications. Here's my situation: I'm 17, my parents can't afford tuition so I need a scholarship, I'm not the smartest kid but I'm the most persistent, I stay after class to ask questions because I genuinely want to understand."

Step 2: Get first draft (raw material)
AI gives you something - but it'll be generic: "I am passionate about learning and excited to contribute..."

Step 3: Direct toward YOUR vision (Habit 4 🧠)
"This sounds like a template written by a 40-year-old. Make it sound like a teenager."
"Okay, but show instead of tell - instead of saying 'I'm passionate,' show me staying after class to ask physics questions."
"Can you organize it around this: I'm the kid who keeps asking questions even when everyone else gets it. That's who I am."

**Result:** Essay sounds like YOU, not a template.

Post: Share your "first draft → directed outcome" journey.
What were you directing AI toward?

🧠 HABIT 4 PRACTICE: You're not accepting AI's output. You're directing it toward what YOU want.

Directors don't just use AI. They shape AI's output to match their vision.
```

**All Day - Agent Monitoring:**
- Direction examples get 🎯 (bullseye = "you're directing!")
- Tracks participation (no public rankings)
- Flags students who haven't posted by 6 PM

**Evening - Peer visibility snapshot:**
```
🌟 TODAY'S DIRECTION JOURNEYS (anonymized):

"Wrote personal statement → Got generic template → Directed: 'Make this sound like a teenager, not a professor' → Now it actually sounds like me"

"Tried to study for physics → Got perfect student plan (4 hours daily, no breaks) → Directed: 'I lose focus after 45 minutes and get overwhelmed. Can we break this into 20-minute chunks?' → Got something I'll actually follow"

"Choosing between CS and business → Got generic 'CS has better jobs' → Directed: 'I'm terrified I'll fail the math. Can you help me think through that anxiety?' → Now I have a framework based on who I actually am"

Notice: First draft was raw material. Direction shaped it to match YOUR reality, not some generic ideal.
```

### Tuesday (Week 6): "Try /synthesize - Write With Clarity"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts continuation of Node 3.1** (reinforcement)

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 NEW CIS AGENT TODAY: Meet /synthesize!

For five weeks, you've been thinking WITH AI.
Today: Learn to synthesize that thinking into clear writing.

What /synthesize does:
Takes your messy AI conversations and helps you write them clearly.

**Example - Before /synthesize:**

*Here's what I've been exploring with AI:*
"I've been trying to decide between computer science and business. AI said CS has better job prospects but business is more flexible. I'm worried about the math in CS because I got a C in calculus, but business feels like giving up. My parents want me to do CS but I'm not sure. I don't know what to do."

**After /synthesize:**

/synthesize "I've been exploring CS vs. business. Here's the tension: CS offers better job prospects but I'm anxious about the math requirements (I got a C in calculus). Business feels safer but I worry it's giving up before I even try. My parents expect CS but I'm not sure it's right for me. Help me see what I'm actually wrestling with."

*AI helps you see:*
"You're not really choosing between CS and business. You're choosing between:
1. Capability anxiety ('Can I handle the math?') vs. Boredom risk ('Will I be engaged?')
2. Parental expectations ('What they want') vs. Your identity ('Who I am')
3. Fear of failure ('CS is too hard') vs. Fear of regret ('Business is giving up')"

See the difference? /synthesize didn't add ideas. It clarified YOUR thinking so you can see patterns.

When to use it:
• When you've explored something with AI and want to write it up clearly
• When you have messy thinking and want to communicate it
• When you're creating your artifact and need structure

Task: Try /synthesize on something you've been exploring with AI.

Post: How did /synthesize help you clarify YOUR thinking?

🧠 HABIT 4 PRACTICE: /synthesize doesn't add ideas. It clarifies YOUR ideas. That's direction.

Good directors don't just accept output. They shape it until it reflects their thinking.
```

**All Day - Agent Engagement:**
- /synthesize usage gets ✍️ (writing = "you're synthesizing!")
- Agent models: "That's YOUR thinking, written clearly"
- Aggregate discoveries into peer visibility

**Evening - Peer visibility moment:**
```
🌟 TODAY'S /synthesize DISCOVERIES (anonymized):

"Exploring career options with AI for days. /synthesize helped me write up what I actually learned."
"Had a messy AI conversation about a difficult decision. /synthesize structured my thinking clearly."
"/synthesize didn't tell me what to think. It helped me see what I'd been thinking all along."

Notice: /synthesize isn't creating for you. It's clarifying YOUR thinking. That's ownership.
```

**6:00 PM - Optional Office Hours**
- Trevor available in voice channel for 30 minutes
- Models direction: "Let me shape this to match my standards..."
- No lectures, just collaborative creation

### Wednesday (Week 6): "Commit to Your Artifact Question"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Artifact Commitment Prompt:**
```
🎯 TODAY: Commit to Your Artifact Question

For the past week, you've been discovering what decision you're actually wrestling with.

Today: Make it official.

**Your Task (15 minutes):**

Step 1: Post your artifact question
"I'm wrestling with: [your question]"

Step 2: Post why it matters to you
"I chose this because: [why this decision is hard, why it matters to your future]"

Step 3: Use /frame to clarify it
"/frame Here's my question: [paste]. Help me see what I'm really asking."

**Example Questions:**

"Should I choose computer science or business?"
"I'm torn because CS has better jobs but I'm terrified of the math (got C in calculus). Business feels safer but like giving up."

"Should I take a gap year?"
"I'm exhausted from high school but worried I'll fall behind everyone else."

"Which university should I attend?"
"My parents want University A because it's prestigious, but I want University B because it has the community I actually need."

**Not sure yet?** That's okay. Post:
"I'm still exploring. Here's what I'm considering: [your options]. Help me see what matters."

🧠 HABIT 4 LIGHT: Today you're using AI to clarify your thinking before committing. That's Habit 4 in action.

This question will become your Thinking Artifact. It doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be YOURS.
```

**9:30 AM - Agent posts Habit 4 Introduction (Light Version):**
```
🧠 HABIT 4: Use AI Before Decisions 🧠

This week, you're learning Habit 4: Use AI before big decisions.

What Habit 4 means:
Don't decide alone, then ask AI for confirmation.
Use AI to think THROUGH the decision before choosing.

**The Decision Pattern:**

1️⃣ PAUSE (Habit 1 ⏸️): "What am I deciding?"
2️⃣ CONTEXT (Habit 2 🎯): "Here's my situation..."
3️⃣ EXPLORE (Habit 3 🔄): /diverge to see options
4️⃣ CHALLENGE (Habit 3): /challenge to test your reasoning
5️⃣ SYNTHESIZE: /synthesize to clarify your thinking
6️⃣ DECIDE: Choose with clarity

**This Week:**
You'll practice this pattern with your artifact question.

Tomorrow we'll go deeper into Habit 4. Today: Just commit to your question and start exploring it with /frame.
```

**All Day - Agent Engagement:**
- Question commitment gets 🎯 (target = "you've committed!")
- Agent celebrates: "You've chosen YOUR question. That's ownership."
- Aggregate into peer visibility

**Evening - Peer visibility moment:**
```
🌟 TODAY'S ARTIFACT QUESTIONS (anonymized):

"I'm wrestling with: CS or business?"
"I chose this because: I'm terrified I'll fail the math in CS (got C in calculus) but business feels like giving up before I even try."

"I'm wrestling with: Gap year or university?"
"I chose this because: I'm exhausted from high school but worried everyone else will move forward without me."

"I'm wrestling with: University A or University B?"
"I chose this because: My parents want A because it's prestigious. I want B because it has the community I actually need. I'm torn between their expectations and my identity."

Notice: These aren't generic decisions. These are real, messy, anxiety-filled choices. That's what makes them worth exploring.

Tomorrow we'll start using Habit 4 to think through these questions WITH AI.
```

### Thursday (Week 6): "I Have Opinions About Quality"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Node 3.2** (NotebookLM podcast: "I Have Opinions About Quality")
- Duration: 8-12 minutes
- Focus: Ownership standards, quality judgment, taste
- Stories of students developing "this isn't good enough yet" mindset

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Develop Your Standards

Yesterday you committed to your artifact question.
Today: Notice that YOU have opinions about quality.

Task: Look at something AI created for you recently - OR look at your artifact question.

Ask yourself:
• "Is this good enough for MY purposes?"
• "What would make this better?"
• "Does this match my standards or someone else's?"

Then direct AI (or your artifact) to improve it:
"This isn't quite what I want because [your standards]"
"Here's what would make this better: [specific direction]"
"I need this to meet my standard for [quality/tone/depth/etc]"

**Example - Directing Your Artifact:**

"My artifact question is 'CS or business?' but that feels too simple. Here's my standard: I need this question to reflect that I'm not just choosing a major - I'm choosing who I become. Can you help me reframe it to capture that?"

Post: ONE standard you discovered YOU have.

🧠 HABIT 4 PRACTICE: Directors don't accept "good enough." They direct until it matches their standards.

Having opinions about quality is ownership. That's the director identity.
```

**All Day - Agent Engagement:**
- Standards development gets ⭐ (star = "you have taste!")
- Agent celebrates: "You're developing ownership - this reflects YOUR standards"
- Aggregate into peer visibility

**Evening - Peer visibility moment:**
```
🌟 TODAY'S STANDARDS DISCOVERIES (anonymized):

"Realized my artifact question 'CS or business?' is too simple. My standard: I need it to reflect that I'm not just choosing a major, I'm choosing who I become."

"Knew the personal statement AI wrote was 'good' but not 'MY voice.' My standard: It has to sound like a confused teenager who keeps trying, not a perfect student who has it all figured out."

"Noticed my study plan isn't detailed enough. My standard: It has to work for someone who loses focus after 45 minutes and gets overwhelmed by long tasks, not some perfect student who studies for 4 hours straight."

Notice: You didn't just accept output. You had standards. That's ownership. That's directing.

### Friday (Week 6): Consolidation & Reflection

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Weekly Reflection Prompt:**
```
🤔 WEEK 6 REFLECTION: You're Becoming a Director

Five weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
This week, you became someone who directs AI intentionally.

That's not nothing. That's capability.

**Reflection Questions:**

1️⃣ What's ONE moment where you shaped AI's output to match your vision? (One sentence)

2️⃣ How did using /synthesize change how you think about your ideas? (One sentence)

3️⃣ 🧠 HABIT 4 CHECK: How natural does "use AI before decisions" feel?
• [ ] Very natural - I automatically think to use AI before big choices
• [ ] Getting there - I remember sometimes
• [ ] Still new - I haven't tried it yet

4️⃣ **REQUIRED:** Paste an example where you directed AI toward your standards (show 2-3 exchanges where you shaped the outcome).

(Example: "AI's first draft → I directed: 'Change this' → AI refined → I directed: 'Adjust that' → Final output matched my vision")

**IMPORTANT:** Complete this INCLUDING the direction example to continue to Week 7.

Take 10 minutes. Be honest. No grading - just noticing your growth.
```

**All Day - Agent Processes Reflections:**
- Mechanical verification: Did they post? (Yes/No)
- Self-assessment routing based on Habit 4 check
- Proof-of-work check: Direction example showing they shaped output?
- Gating: Week 7 content unlocks only after reflection WITH proof-of-work

**Agent Routing Based on Self-Assessment:**

| Student Response | Agent Response |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Very natural - I automatically use AI" | "That's Habit 4 forming! You're thinking WITH AI before you decide." |
| "Getting there - I remember sometimes" | "Normal! Week 6 was just introduction. Week 7 will give you more practice." |
| "Still new - haven't tried it yet" | "Totally okay! Habit 4 is new this week. You'll get there with practice." |

**Friday Spot-Check (Trevor's 10%):**
- Trevor reviews 15-20 reflections (random sample)
- Looks for: Evidence of direction, ownership standards, students needing support
- Escalations: If student says "I still just accept AI's output" → Flag for outreach

### Saturday-Sunday (Week 6): Integration Rest

**Agent posts Saturday message:**
```
🌟 WEEK 6 COMPLETE!

You learned to direct AI intentionally.
You met /synthesize (clarify YOUR thinking).
You discovered that first drafts are raw material.
You started using AI BEFORE making decisions.

You're not just "using AI" anymore. You're directing AI toward what matters to you.

Next week is Week 7: I CREATE WITH INTENTION.
We'll deepen your director identity.
You'll cement ownership: "I made this."
And you'll continue creating your artifact.

Rest this weekend. You've earned it. 🎯

🧠 WEEKEND CHALLENGE (optional):
Notice yourself this weekend facing a decision or choice.

Don't actually use AI - just THINK:
"How would I think through this with AI? What would I ask? Which tools would I use?"

That mental rehearsal? That's Habit 4 becoming part of how you approach decisions.
```

**No mandatory tasks Saturday-Sunday.** Integration time is sacred.

### Monday (Week 7): "Direction Techniques Work"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Node 3.3** (NotebookLM podcast: "Direction Techniques That Actually Work")
- Duration: 8-12 minutes
- Focus: Specific direction techniques, concrete examples
- Stories of students directing AI toward specific outcomes

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Director's Techniques

You know you CAN direct AI. Today: Specific techniques that work.

Direction Techniques:

1. The "Like / Change" Method
"Here's what I like about this: [specific praise]"
"Here's what I want to change: [specific direction]"
"Here's why: [your standards/reasoning]"

2. The "Example" Method
"Give me an example of what you mean"
"Show me, don't just tell me"
"Model the tone/style I'm looking for"

3. The "Constraint" Method
"Here are my constraints: [time, resources, situation]"
"Work within these boundaries: [specific limits]"
"Respect these requirements: [non-negotiables]"

Task: Try ONE direction technique with AI today.

Post: Which technique did you use? How did it work?

🧠 HABIT 4 PRACTICE: Good directors are specific about what they want. Vague direction = vague results.

Intentional directors don't hope for good output. They direct toward specific outcomes.
```

**9:00 AM - Agent posts continuation of Node 3.3** (reinforcement)

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Develop Your Standards

For six weeks, AI has been giving you outputs.
Today: Notice that YOU have opinions about quality.

Task: Look at something AI created for you recently.

Ask yourself:
• "Is this good enough for MY purposes?"
• "What would make this better?"
• "Does this match my standards or someone else's?"

Then direct AI to improve it:
"This isn't quite what I want because [your standards]"
"Here's what would make this better: [specific direction]"
"I need this to meet my standard for [quality/tone/depth/etc]"

Post: ONE standard you discovered YOU have.

🧠 HABIT 4 PRACTICE: Directors don't accept "good enough." They direct until it matches their standards.

Having opinions about quality is ownership. That's the director identity.

- Duration: 8-12 minutes
- Focus: Identity transformation, "I made this" moments
- Stories of students creating work they're proud of

**9:15 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Artifact Work + "I Made This"

You've been creating your artifact since last week. Today: Reflect on ownership.

Look at your artifact-in-progress (or any work you've created WITH AI):

Say out loud: "I made this."

Notice:
• Did that feel true or uncomfortable?
• Can you identify YOUR thinking in this work?
• What parts reflect your decisions, your direction, your standards?

Then continue working on your artifact:
Use /frame to clarify what you're trying to show
Use /diverge to explore how to present it
Use /challenge to test if it demonstrates your thinking
Use /synthesize to write it clearly

Post: One sentence about "I made this" - does it feel true?

🧠 HABIT 4 INTEGRATION: Your artifact isn't about AI. It's about YOUR thinking.

Directors don't say "AI made this." They say "I made this WITH AI."
```

**All Day - Agent Engagement:**
- Ownership reflection gets ✨✨ (double spark = "breakthrough!")

### Thursday (Week 7): "Artifact Sprint"

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Daily Prompt:**
```
🧠 TODAY'S PRACTICE: Artifact Sprint Day

Next week is Week 8: Artifact completion and showcase.
Today: Make serious progress on your artifact.

The Thinking Artifact Structure:

THE QUESTION I WRESTLED WITH:
[Your chosen question]

HOW I REFRAMED IT:
[Using /frame with The Framer]

WHAT I EXPLORED:
[Using /diverge with The Explorer]

WHAT I CHALLENGED:
[Using /challenge with The Challenger]

WHAT I CONCLUDED:
[Using /synthesize with The Synthesizer]

WHAT THIS TAUGHT ME:
[Reflection on your thinking growth]

Task: Spend 30-45 minutes making progress. Then post:

• Which section did you work on?
• What did you discover about YOUR thinking?
• One sentence: What does this artifact show about you?

🧠 HABIT 4 INTEGRATION: Your artifact uses all four habits. It shows you think WITH AI.

You're not just submitting work. You're demonstrating identity: "I am someone who thinks WITH AI."
```

**All Day - Agent Engagement:**
- Artifact work gets 💪 (strength = "you're creating!")

Now? You're someone who directs AI intentionally.

That's not a small change. That's transformation.

**Reflection Questions:**

1️⃣ What's ONE standard you discovered YOU have? (One sentence)

2️⃣ Can you say "I made this" about work you've created WITH AI? (Yes/No/Working on it)

3️⃣ 🧠 HABIT 4 CHECK: How natural does "use AI before decisions" feel now?
• [ ] Very natural - I automatically think to use AI for important decisions
• [ ] Getting there - I remember sometimes
• [ ] Still new - I'm just starting

4️⃣ **REQUIRED:** Paste an example where you directed AI to match YOUR standards (show 2-3 exchanges).

(Example: "AI's output → I said 'This needs to match my standard for X' → Directed specific changes → Final output reflected my standards")

**IMPORTANT:** Complete this INCLUDING the direction example to continue to Week 8.

Take 10 minutes. Be honest. No grading - just noticing your growth.
```

**All Day - Agent Processes Reflections:**
- Mechanical verification: Did they post? (Yes/No)
- Self-assessment routing
- Proof-of-work check: Direction showing ownership and standards?
- Gating: Week 8 content unlocks only after reflection WITH proof-of-work

**Agent Routing:**

| Student Response | Agent Response |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Very natural - I automatically use AI" | "Habit 4 installed! You're someone who thinks WITH AI before deciding." |
| "Getting there" | "Great progress! Week 8 will reinforce this as you complete your artifact." |
| "Still new" | "Totally normal! You're building something that lasts. Keep practicing." |

**Friday Spot-Check (Trevor's 10%):**
- Trevor reviews 15-20 reflections
- Looks for: Evidence of director identity, ownership, students needing support
- Escalations: If student says "I still just accept whatever AI gives" → Flag for outreach

### Saturday-Sunday (Week 7): Integration Rest & Transition

**Agent posts Saturday message:**
```
🌟 WEEKS 6-7 COMPLETE!

You learned to direct AI intentionally.
You discovered that first drafts are raw material.
You developed ownership and standards.
You started using AI BEFORE decisions.
You began creating your artifact.

You're now someone who DIRECTS AI.
That's different from six weeks ago. That's growth.

📊 QUICK CHECKPOINT:
Where are you now?

• You've witnessed AI (Week 1)
• You've experienced it working for YOU (Weeks 2-3)
• You've learned to iterate and explore (Weeks 4-5)
• You've learned to direct with intention (Weeks 6-7)
• You've built four habits that last (Pause ⏸️, Context 🎯, Iterate 🔄, Think First 🧠)

Next week is Week 8: ARTIFACT COMPLETION & SHOWCASE.
You'll finalize your artifact - proof you think WITH AI.
You'll share it with peers and celebrate each other's thinking.
You'll receive your 4 Habits card - graduation proof.

Rest this weekend. You've earned it. 🎓

🧠 WEEKEND CHALLENGE (optional):
Notice yourself this weekend WITHOUT using AI.

Just observe your identity:
"I'm someone who pauses before asking..."
"I'm someone who explains context..."
"I'm someone who iterates..."
"I'm someone who thinks WITH AI before decisions..."

Those aren't just skills. They're who you are now. That's permanent transformation.
```

**No mandatory tasks Saturday-Sunday.** Integration time is sacred.

## The 4 Nodes: Full Specifications (Zone 3→4)

### Node 3.1: "First Draft Is Raw Material"

**Identity Shift:** "AI's output is final" → "AI's output is starting point"
**Emotional Job:** Capability + agency
**4 Habit Reinforced:** Habit 4 (Use AI before decisions) - as director

**Concept:** Iteration mindset (shape, don't just accept)
**Experience:** "I can direct AI until the output matches my vision"

**NotebookLM Podcast Specifications:**

**Title:** "First Drafts Are Raw Material"
**Duration:** 8-12 minutes
**Format:** Two-host conversational podcast + before/after direction examples

**Host Guide:**
```
Host A: "You've been collaborating with AI for five weeks. Here's what most students still get wrong."
Host B: "They treat AI's first output like it's final."

[The Raw Material Mindset]
Host A: "What should they do instead?"
Host B: "Treat it like raw material. Like clay you shape."

[Story 1: Essay direction]
Host A: "I was writing my personal statement for university applications."
Host B: "High stakes. The anxiety is real."
Host A: "Exactly. I asked AI for help and got this... template. 'I am passionate about learning and excited to contribute...'"
Host B: "Generic. Could be anyone."
Host A: "Right. And I'm sitting there thinking: 'My parents can't afford tuition if I don't get a scholarship. This has to stand out. This has to be ME.'"
Host B: "So you directed?"
Host A: "Me: 'This is too formal. I'm 17, not a 40-year-old writing a grant proposal. Make it sound like an actual teenager wrote it.'"
Host B: "Iteration 1."
Host A: "AI: [Rewrites]. Better, but still not me. Me: 'Okay, but here's the thing - I'm not just 'passionate about learning.' I'm the kid who stays after class to ask physics questions because I'm genuinely confused, not because I want points. Can you show THAT instead of telling it?'"
Host B: "Iteration 2 with your actual situation."
Host A: "AI: [Adds example]. Me: 'Great. Now can you organize it around this: I'm not the smartest kid in class, but I'm the one who keeps asking questions even when everyone else gets it. That's who I am.'"
Host B: "Final direction toward YOUR identity."
Host A: "By the end, it wasn't a template anymore. It was mine. AI didn't write it - AI helped me write like myself."

[Story 2: Decision direction]
Host B: "I was trying to decide between computer science and business."
Host A: "That's the choice that keeps 17-year-olds up at night."
Host B: "Exactly. My parents expect me to choose CS because 'that's where the jobs are.' But I'm terrified - I struggled through math in high school, I got a C in calculus. What if I can't handle the CS math requirements?"
Host A: "Capability anxiety."
Host B: "Right. So I asked AI: 'Should I do CS or business?' and got back: 'CS offers better career prospects and higher starting salaries...'"
Host A: "Generic advice. Not helpful."
Host B: "Me: 'That doesn't help. Here's my actual situation: I'm good at problem-solving but bad at abstract math. I'm worried I'll fail out of CS. But business feels like giving up before I even try.'"
Host A: "Now it's real."
Host B: "AI: [Gives more nuanced comparison]. But I realized: 'This is still logical. I'm feeling anxious, not logical. Can you help me explore that?'"
Host A: "Directed toward your emotions."
Host B: "AI: [Helps process anxiety]. We uncovered: I'm not scared of CS. I'm scared of being the kid who can't keep up. Me: 'Okay. Can you compare CS and business on something else? Which path lets me stay curious? Because I love learning how things work.'"
Host A: "Directed toward YOUR values."
Host B: "By the end, I didn't have a generic 'CS is better' answer. I had a framework based on who I actually am, not who my parents want me to be."

[The Direction Pattern]
Host A: "Here's the pattern I'm hearing:"
Host B: "First draft: Acceptable but generic"
Host A: "Direction 1: 'Make it more like X'"
Host B: "Direction 2: 'Add my specific situation'"
Host A: "Direction 3: 'Shape toward my standards'"
Host B: "Final output: Reflects YOUR vision"

[Connect to Habit 4]
Host B: "And Habit 4 is about being intentional:"
Host A: "Don't just accept output."
Host B: "Direct it until it matches what YOU want."

[Why This Works]
Host A: "Why is 'raw material' mindset so powerful?"
Host B: "Because it gives you permission to be picky."
Host A: "You're not being ungrateful. You're directing."
Host B: "AI isn't creative. It's predictive. It needs your direction to match your vision."

[JTBD-Relevant Direction Examples]
Host A: "Real examples of directing AI with real student context:"
Host B: "Personal statement (financial anxiety): 'Make this sound like a 17-year-old, not a textbook' → 'My parents can't afford tuition if I don't get a scholarship - can you help me emphasize my work ethic?' → 'Focus on this theme: I'm not the smartest, but I'm the most persistent'"
Host A: "Study decisions (capability anxiety): 'Give me a plan' → 'I lose focus after 45 minutes and get overwhelmed by long study sessions' → 'I'm terrified I'll fail physics - can we break this into 20-minute chunks?'"

[Connect to Identity Shift]
Host B: "When students realize 'first draft is raw material'..."
Host A: "They stop waiting for AI to read their minds."
Host B: "They start directing intentionally until output matches their standards."

[Closing invitation]
Host A: "This week, treat everything AI gives you as raw material."
Host B: "Direct it. Shape it. Make it yours."
Host A: "You're not just using AI. You're directing AI toward your vision."

Host B: "That's the director mindset."
```

### Node 3.2: "I Have Opinions About Quality"

**Identity Shift:** "AI knows best" → "I have standards"
**Emotional Job:** Ownership + taste
**4 Habit Reinforced:** Habit 4 (Use AI before decisions) - developing judgment

**Concept:** Ownership standards (quality judgment)
**Experience:** "I know what I want, and I can direct AI to get it"

**NotebookLM Podcast Specifications:**

**Title:** "I Have Opinions About Quality"
**Duration:** 8-12 minutes
**Format:** Two-host conversational podcast + standards development stories

**Host Guide:**
```
Host A: "Something shifts when you've been using AI for a few weeks."
Host B: "What's that?"
Host A: "You stop accepting whatever AI gives you."

[The Standards Shift]
Host B: "Because you realize you have opinions about quality."
Host A: "Exactly. You develop taste. Standards. Judgment."

[Story 1: Essay standards]
Host B: "I asked AI for feedback on my essay."
Host A: "And it gave you generic praise?"
Host B: "Right. 'Great job! Well-written! Good arguments!'"
Host A: "And?"
Host B: "I remember thinking: 'This isn't helpful. I know it's not perfect. What's ACTUALLY wrong with it?'"
Host A: "So you directed?"
Host B: "Me: 'Don't just praise it. Give me specific critique. What's weak? What's confusing? What would make this actually good?'"
Host A: "Directed toward YOUR standards."
Host B: "AI gave me real feedback. And I realized: I have standards. I know what 'good' means to me."

[Story 2: Decision standards]
Host A: "I was talking to AI about a university decision."
Host B: "One-shot approach?"
Host A: "I asked: 'Should I choose this university?'"
Host B: "Generic advice back?"
Host A: "AI gave me all these logical reasons. But something felt off."
Host B: "So you used your judgment?"
Host A: "Me: 'This all makes sense logically. But I'm feeling anxious. Help me explore that.'"
Host B: "Oh, interesting. You honored your emotional standard."
Host A: "Right. We talked through the anxiety. Turns out I was worried about fitting in socially."
Host B: "So?"
Host A: "AI helped me see that my 'logical' choice ignored something important to me: community."
Host B: "You have standards about what matters in decisions."
Host A: "Exactly. Logic isn't enough. I need to feel like I belong."

[The Standards Pattern]
Host B: "Here's what I'm hearing:"
Host A: "First: Accept AI's output"
Host B: "Then: Notice 'this isn't quite right'"
Host A: "Then: Identify YOUR standard"
Host B: "Finally: Direct toward that standard"

[Connect to Habit 4]
Host A: "Habit 4 is about developing judgment:"
Host B: "You don't just accept output."
Host A: "You check: Does this match my standards?"

[Why This Matters]
Host B: "Why is having opinions about quality so important?"
Host A: "Because that's ownership."
Host B: "If you accept whatever AI gives you..."
Host A: "You're saying 'AI knows better than me.'"
Host B: "But when you have standards and direct toward them..."
Host A: "You're saying 'I know what I want, and I'll make this work.'"

[JTBD-Relevant Standards]
Host A: "Real standards students develop:"
Host B: "Personal statements: 'It has to sound like ME, not a template'"
Host A: "Study plans: 'It has to be realistic, not some perfect schedule I'll quit'"
Host B: "Decisions: 'It has to honor both logic AND emotion, not just one'"

[Standards as Identity]
Host B: "When you develop standards..."
Host A: "You're developing identity."
Host B: "You're saying: 'This is what matters to me. This is what I'll accept.'"

[Connect to Identity Shift]
Host A: "The shift from 'AI knows best' to 'I have standards'..."
Host B: "That's the director identity."
Host A: "You're not just using AI. You're directing AI toward YOUR vision of quality."

[Closing invitation]
Host B: "This week, notice your standards."
Host A: "When something AI gives you feels 'off'..."
Host B: "Don't just accept it. Ask: What's my standard here?"
Host A: "Then direct until it matches."

Host B: "That's ownership."
```

**Guardrails Compliance:**
- ✅ Focus on student's standards, not AI quality
- ✅ Normalize having opinions and taste
- ✅ JTBD-relevant standards (essays, decisions, plans)
- ✅ Judgment as life skill, not just AI skill
- ✅ Connects Habit 4 to developing taste

**JTBD Altitude:** Level 3-4
- Level 3: "I have standards"
- Level 4: "I direct toward my vision of quality"

**Brand Voice:** Ownership + Taste
- "You know what you want"

### Node 3.3: "Direction Techniques Work"

**Identity Shift:** "I hope for good output" → "I direct toward specific outcomes"
**Emotional Job:** Efficacy + skill
**4 Habit Reinforced:** Habit 4 (Use AI before decisions) - tactical direction

**Concept:** Direction techniques (specific methods)
**Experience:** "I have techniques that reliably shape AI's output"

**NotebookLM Podcast Specifications:**

**Title:** "Direction Techniques That Actually Work"
**Duration:** 8-12 minutes
**Format:** Two-host conversational podcast + technique demonstrations

**Host Guide:**
```
Host A: "You know you CAN direct AI. But HOW?"
Host B: "Great question. Let's talk specific techniques."

[Technique 1: The "Like / Change" Method]
Host A: "Here's a technique that always works: Like / Change."
Host B: "How does it work?"

Host A: "Start with what you like, then say what you want to change."
Host B: "Give me an example."

Host A: "AI gives you something. You say:"
"Here's what I like about this: [specific praise]"
"Here's what I want to change: [specific direction]"
"Here's why: [your reasoning]"

Host B: "And that works better than just saying 'fix this'?"
Host A: "Much better. AI learns what you want by understanding what you like AND what you want to change."

[Story 1: Like/Change in action]
Host B: "I used Like/Change on my personal statement."
Host A: "Show me."
Host B: "Me: 'I like that it's organized. But I want to change the tone - it's too formal. I'm 17, not 40. Make it sound like a student wrote it.'"
Host A: "Specific."
Host B: "AI rewrote it. Me: 'I like that it's more casual now. But can you change the opening? It's too generic. Here's the story I actually want to start with...'"
Host A: "More direction."
Host B: "By the end, it sounded like ME."

[Technique 2: The "Example" Method]
Host A: "Here's another technique: Ask for examples."
Host B: "Why?"
Host A: "Because 'show me' is more specific than 'tell me'."

[Story 2: Example method]
Host B: "I was confused about a difficult concept in one of my classes."
Host A: "One-shot approach?"
Host B: "'Explain quantum physics to me.' Got back this super technical explanation."
Host A: "So you used the Example method?"
Host B: "Me: 'This is too abstract. Can you give me a concrete example? Like, a real-world situation I'd actually encounter?'"
Host A: "Asked for example."
Host B: "AI gave me an example. Me: 'Okay, but can you give me another example from everyday life? Like something I'd see at home or school?'"
Host A: "Asked for relatable example."
Host B: "Finally got it. The example method made abstract concepts concrete."

[Technique 3: The "Constraint" Method]
Host B: "Third technique: Constraints."
Host A: "Why?"
Host B: "AI will give you generic advice unless you give it YOUR constraints."

[Story 3: Constraint method]
Host A: "I asked for a study plan."
Host B: "Generic plan back?"
Host A: "Perfect student plan: 'Study 4 hours every day, no breaks, just focus.'"
Host B: "Unrealistic."
Host A: "Me: 'This doesn't work for me. Here are my constraints: I lose focus after 45 minutes. I have tests in 2 weeks, not 2 months. I need time for extracurriculars. Work within THAT.'"
Host B: "Gave your constraints."
Host A: "AI adjusted the plan. Suddenly it was something I'd actually do."

[The Technique Pattern]
Host B: "Let me summarize the three techniques:"
Host A: "1. Like / Change: What works + what needs to change + why"
Host B: "2. Example: 'Show me' instead of 'tell me'"
Host A: "3. Constraint: 'Work within MY limits' instead of generic advice"

[Connect to Habit 4]
Host B: "Habit 4 is about being intentional:"
Host A: "Don't just hope for good output."
Host B: "Use techniques that reliably shape outcomes."

[Why Techniques Work]
Host A: "Why do these techniques work so well?"
Host B: "Because they're specific."
Host A: "Vague direction = vague output."
Host B: "Specific techniques = specific outcomes."

[JTBD-Relevant Technique Applications]
Host A: "Real technique applications:"
Host B: "Personal statements: Like/Change to refine voice, Example to see tone options, Constraint for word count"
Host A: "Study decisions: Like/Change to customize approach, Example to see what works, Constraint for time limits"
Host B: "Career exploration: Like/Change to narrow focus, Example to understand day-to-day reality, Constraint for location/salary/etc"

[Connect to Identity Shift]
Host B: "When you have reliable techniques..."
Host A: "You stop hoping AI reads your mind."
Host B: "You start directing intentionally."

[Closing invitation]
Host A: "This week, try the three techniques:"
Host B: "Like/Change, Example, Constraint."
Host A: "Notice which ones work for you."
Host B: "You're not just using AI. You're directing with skill."

Host A: "That's efficacy."
```

**Guardrails Compliance:**
- ✅ Techniques are concrete and teachable
- ✅ Examples show technique application, not magic
- ✅ JTBD-relevant applications (statements, study, careers)
- ✅ Focus on skill development, not native talent
- ✅ Connects Habit 4 to tactical direction

**JTBD Altitude:** Level 3-4
- Level 3: "These techniques work"
- Level 4: "I can reliably direct outcomes"

**Brand Voice:** Efficacy + Skill
- "You have techniques that work"
- "Direct with specific methods"

### Node 3.4: "I Made This"

**Identity Shift:** "AI helped me" → "I made this WITH AI"
**Emotional Job:** Pride + identity
**4 Habit Reinforced:** Habit 4 (Use AI before decisions) - ownership integration

**Concept:** Ownership identity (work reflects ME)
**Experience:** "This artifact shows MY thinking, not AI's capabilities"

**NotebookLM Podcast Specifications:**

**Title:** "The Identity Shift to Director"
**Duration:** 8-12 minutes
**Format:** Two-host conversational podcast + "I made this" moments

**Host Guide:**
```
Host A: "Six weeks ago, you were curious about AI."
Host B: "Today, you're someone who directs AI intentionally."
Host A: "That's not a small change. That's transformation."

[The Identity Shift]
Host B: "Let's talk about that moment when identity shifts."
Host A: "The moment you can say 'I made this' and really mean it."

[Story 1: First "I made this" moment]
Host B: "I was working on my artifact."
Host A: "Your Thinking Artifact?"
Host B: "Right. I'd been talking to AI about this decision I was trying to make."
Host A: "And you used /synthesize to write it up?"
Host B: "Yeah. But when I read what /synthesize helped me write..."
Host A: "What did you feel?"
Host B: "I remember thinking: 'This is mine. These are my insights. This is MY thinking.'"
Host A: "Not 'AI's insights'?"
Host B: "No. AI helped me clarify it. But these are things I noticed. Things I concluded."
Host A: "That's the identity shift."
Host B: "I looked at this artifact and thought: 'I made this. With AI, yes. But this is MY work.'"

[Story 2: Director identity]
Host A: "I was showing my friend something I created with AI."
Host B: "And?"
Host A: "They asked: 'Wow, AI made that?'"
Host B: "What did you say?"
Host A: "Without thinking, I said: 'No. I made this. AI helped me, but this is mine.'"
Host B: "Oh! You corrected them automatically."
Host A: "Right. In Week 1, I would've said 'Yeah, AI is amazing.'"
Host B: "But now?"
Host A: "Now I know the difference. AI doesn't make things. AI helps ME make things."

[The Identity Pattern]
Host B: "Here's the pattern I'm hearing:"
Host A: "Before: 'AI helped me' or 'AI made this'"
Host B: "After: 'I made this WITH AI'"
Host A: "Before: Giving credit to AI"
Host B: "After: Owning your work"

[Connect to All 4 Habits]
Host A: "This identity shift happens because all 4 habits work together:"
Host B: "Habit 1 (Pause ⏸️): You know what YOU want"
Host A: "Habit 2 (Context 🎯): You explain YOUR situation"
Host B: "Habit 3 (Iterate 🔄): You shape toward YOUR vision"
Host A: "Habit 4 (Think First 🧠): You decide with YOUR judgment"

[Why "I Made This" Matters]
Host B: "Why is 'I made this' so important?"
Host A: "Because that's ownership."
Host B: "If you say 'AI made this'..."
Host A: "You're saying 'I'm not capable.'"
Host B: "But when you say 'I made this WITH AI'..."
Host A: "You're saying 'I'm a director. I think WITH AI.'"

[JTBD-Relevant "I Made This" Moments]
Host A: "Real 'I made this' moments:"
Host B: "Personal statements: 'AI didn't write this. These are my stories, organized around my thesis.'"
Host A: "Decisions: 'AI didn't decide for me. AI helped me think through what I already wanted.'"
Host B: "Understanding complex topics: 'AI didn't give me knowledge. AI helped me structure MY learning.'"

[Artifact as Identity Proof]
Host B: "Your artifact isn't just showing you can use AI."
Host A: "It's showing you think WITH AI."
Host B: "Every section reflects YOUR habits:"
Host A: "How you frame questions (Habit 1)"
Host B: "How you explain your situation (Habit 2)"
Host A: "How you explore and challenge (Habit 3)"
Host B: "How you synthesize and conclude (Habit 4)"

[Connect to Identity Shift]
Host A: "When you can say 'I made this' about your artifact..."
Host B: "You're not just completing an assignment."
Host A: "You're demonstrating transformation."

[Closing invitation]
Host B: "This week, as you work on your artifact:"
Host A: "Ask yourself: Can I say 'I made this' and mean it?"
Host B: "Look for YOUR thinking in every section."
Host A: "This isn't about AI's capabilities."
Host B: "It's about YOUR transformation."

Host A: "That's the director identity."
```

**Guardrails Compliance:**
- ✅ Focus on student ownership, not AI capabilities
- ✅ Normalize identity transformation as process
- ✅ JTBD-relevant "I made this" moments (statements, decisions, learning)
- ✅ Artifact as proof, not just assignment
- ✅ All 4 habits integrated

**JTBD Altitude:** Level 4
- Level 4: "I am someone who thinks WITH AI"

**Brand Voice:** Pride + Identity
- "This is YOUR work"
- "You made this WITH AI"

## Trevor's Live Sessions: Weeks 6-7

**Format:** 1-hour sessions per cluster (alternating days)
**Total for Weeks 6-7:** 2 sessions per cluster (one in Week 6, one in Week 7)

### Week 6 Session Script (60 minutes)

**Opening (5 min):**
```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 6 live session.

Five weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
This week, you're becoming directors.

Big shift: Not 'AI helps me' but 'I direct AI intentionally.'

I'm not here to teach you tricks. I'm here to explore with you.

Let's start with: What's surprised you about directing AI?"
```

**Student Sharing (20 min):**
- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice when you started directing AI toward your standards?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?"
- Celebrates ownership: "You're developing taste - that's powerful"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

**Habit 4 Demonstration (15 min):**
```
"Let's practice Habit 4 together: Use AI Before Decisions.

I'm going to show you how I'd think through a decision WITH AI.
I want you to notice my thinking process.

[Demonstrates decision-making with AI]
Me: '/frame I'm trying to decide whether to [decision]. Here's what's confusing me: [explain].'
AI: [Helps frame the question]
Me: '/diverge Help me see options I hadn't considered'
AI: [Explores multiple angles]
Me: '/challenge Here's my current thinking: [explain]. Stress-test it.'
AI: [Challenges assumptions]
Me: '/synthesize Help me write up what I've learned and what I'm leaning toward'
AI: [Synthesizes thinking]

Notice: I didn't ask AI to decide FOR me.
I used AI to think BEFORE I decide.

Now your turn. Turn to partner:
'What's a decision you're facing? How would you use AI to think through it?'

[Students practice in pairs]
```

**New CIS Agent Demo: /synthesize (10 min):**
```
"This week you met a new thinking tool: /synthesize

What /synthesize does:
Takes your rough thinking and AI conversations, then helps you write them clearly.

When to use it:
• When you've been exploring a topic and want to write it up
• When you're creating your artifact and need structure
• When you have messy ideas and want to communicate them

Let me show you /synthesize in action..."
[Trevor demonstrates /synthesize on rough thinking]
"...see how it clarified MY thinking without adding ideas?"

You have all four tools now. Use them to direct.
```

**Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min):**
- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have about directing AI or your artifact?"
- Authentic thinking, not prepared answers

**Closing (5 min):**
```
"This week, you learned to direct AI intentionally.
You met /synthesize.
You started using AI BEFORE decisions.

Next week is Week 7: I CREATE WITH INTENTION.
We'll deepen your director identity.
You'll cement ownership: 'I made this.'
You'll continue working on your artifact.

For now: Notice when you direct AI naturally.
That's the director identity forming.

See you in Discord. 🧠"
```

### Week 7 Session Script (60 minutes)

**Opening (5 min):**
```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 7 live session.

Six weeks ago, you were curious about AI.
Now? You're someone who directs AI intentionally.

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Let's start with: Can you say 'I made this' about work you've created WITH AI?"
```

**Student Sharing (20 min):**
- Trevor asks: "What's ONE standard you discovered YOU have?"
- Celebrates ownership: "You're developing taste - that's the director identity"
- No evaluation, authentic curiosity

**All 4 Habits Integration (15 min):**
```
"Let's see all four habits working together as a director:

Habit 1: Pause ⏸️ - What do I actually want?
Habit 2: Context 🎯 - Here's my situation...
Habit 3: Iterate 🔄 - Change one thing at a time
Habit 4: Think First 🧠 - Use AI before decisions

I'm going to demonstrate directing AI to create something:
'Make a study plan for my upcoming exams'

[Habit 1 Pause]
First, I pause. What do I actually want?
I want a plan I'll ACTUALLY follow, not some perfect plan.

[Habit 2 Context]
Now I explain my situation:
'I have 3 exams in 2 weeks. I'm most worried about physics. I learn better with examples than abstract theory. I burn out if I don't take breaks.'

[Habit 3 Iterate]
Then I iterate as AI responds:
- First output: 'This is too rigid. Can you add flexibility?'
- Second output: 'Still too much study time. Can you adjust for my other commitments?'
- Third output: 'Can you make it more visual? I'm a visual learner.'

[Habit 4 Think First]
Before I commit to this plan, I think through it:
'/challenge Here's my plan. Help me see what might go wrong.'
'/synthesize Help me write this plan down clearly.'

See? All four habits working together to direct AI toward MY standards.

Your turn. With a partner:
1. What do you want to create or decide?
2. How would all four habits help you direct AI?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

**Artifact Focus (10 min):**
```
"Next week is Week 8: Artifact completion and showcase.

Your artifact will show all four habits:
- You can frame questions (Habit 1)
- You can explain context (Habit 2)
- You can explore and challenge (Habit 3)
- You can use AI to think before decisions (Habit 4)

It's not about 'what AI can do.'
It's about 'how YOU think WITH AI.'

This week, spend serious time on your artifact.
Make it something you're proud of.
Something where you can say 'I made this.'

Week 8 you'll share it with peers and celebrate each other's thinking."
```

**Q&A / Open Conversation (10 min):**
- Floor opens: "What are you noticing about directing AI and creating your artifact?"
- Authentic conversation about director identity

**Closing (5 min):**
```
"Six weeks ago, you were learning to use AI.
Now you're someone who directs AI intentionally.

That's not nothing. That's transformation.

Next week is Week 8: ARTIFACT COMPLETION & SHOWCASE.
You'll finalize your artifact - proof you think WITH AI.
You'll share it with peers and celebrate each other.
You'll receive your 4 Habits card - graduation proof.

You're ready for this. You've built the skills. You've developed the identity.

See you in Discord. 🎓"
```

## Agent Behavior Specifications: Weeks 6-7

### Agent Tone & Voice
- **Level 3-4 Language:** Framework → Identity ("I direct with intention")
- **Revolutionary Hope Tone:** Empowerment through creation
- **Emojis:** 🧠 (thinking), 🎯 (direction), ✨ (creation), 🎓 (graduation), ⭐ (standards)
- **No comparisons:** Never rankings, only aggregate patterns

### Agent Response Templates (Week 6)

**For Monday-Thursday submissions:**
```
[Direction examples]:
🎯 "You're directing AI toward your vision! That's the director mindset."

[/synthesize usage]:
✍️ "YOUR thinking, written clearly. That's ownership."

[Decision thinking]:
🧠 "You used AI to think BEFORE deciding. That's wisdom."

[Standards development]:
⭐ "You have opinions about quality. That's taste. That's ownership."

[Full toolkit usage]:
🛠️ "All four tools working together? You're directing with skill."

[If students feel overwhelmed]:
"Direction takes practice. Week 6 is just learning the techniques. You're on track."

[Gentle nudge if not posted by 6 PM]:
"Hey! Today's practice is waiting when you're ready. Try directing AI toward YOUR standards. 🎯"
```

**For Friday reflections (Week 6):**
```
[Reflection posted]:
"Thanks for sharing! You're experiencing that you can direct AI intentionally."

[Habit 4 self-assessment routing:
- "Very natural": "Habit 4 forming! You're thinking WITH AI before you decide."
- "Sometimes": "Normal! Habit 4 takes repetition. Week 7 will give you more practice."
- "Still new": "Totally okay! Week 6 was just introduction. You're building skill that lasts."

[Proof-of-work validation]:
"This direction example shows Habit 4 in action: [paste]. You directed until output matched YOUR standards. Week 7 unlocked! 🔓"
```

### Agent Response Templates (Week 7)

**For Monday-Thursday submissions:**
```
[Direction technique usage]:
🎯✨ "Masterful direction! You're using techniques that work."

[Standards reflection]:
⭐ "You have taste. You know what you want. That's the director identity."

[Ownership moments]:
✨✨ "You said 'I made this' and meant it. That's the identity shift."

[Artifact progress]:
💪 "This isn't just an assignment. It's proof of YOUR transformation."

[If students feel stuck]:
"Director identity takes time to sink in. You're on track - keep directing."

[If students say "I still just accept AI's output"]:
"That's okay! Week 7 is about developing standards. You'll get there with practice."
```

**For Friday reflections (Week 7):**
```
[Reflection posted]:
"Seven weeks of growth. You're different now than when you started. That's transformation."

[Habit 4 self-assessment routing:
- "Very natural": "Habit 4 installed! You're someone who thinks WITH AI before deciding."
- "Getting there": "Great progress! Director identity is forming. Week 8 will reinforce this."
- "Still new": "Totally normal! You're building something that lasts. Stay with it."

[Proof-of-work validation]:
"This direction example shows ownership: [paste]. You directed until it matched YOUR standards. Week 8 unlocked! 🔓"
```
