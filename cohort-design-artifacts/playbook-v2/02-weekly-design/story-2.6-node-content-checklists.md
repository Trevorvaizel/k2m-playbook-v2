## Overview

This document provides **zone-specific content checklists** for validating every node before student delivery. These checklists ensure all 16 nodes (4 per zone) meet guardrails, JTBD relevance, and quality standards.

**Foundation Reference:** Built on Epic 1.3 (Node-Based Learning Architecture) - see `playbook-v2/01-philosophy/node-architecture.md`

**Who Uses This:**
- Trevor when reviewing NotebookLM-generated podcasts
- Content creators when producing node materials
- QA team before node deployment to Discord

**Core Principle:** Every node must pass **ALL checks** in its zone-specific checklist before going live.

---

## Universal Pre-Check (All Zones)

**These apply to EVERY node, regardless of zone.**

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Node targets ONE zone transition (0→1, 1→2, 2→3, or 3→4)
- [ ] Node has clear identity shift ("From X to Y")
- [ ] Node addresses ONE emotional job (belonging, confidence, companionship, ownership)
- [ ] Node reinforces ONE 4 Habit (pause, context, change, use before deciding)
- [ ] Node is NotebookLM-compatible (conversational, not lecture)
- [ ] Node duration is 8-12 minutes

### Guardrails Compliance (Epic 1.1)
- [ ] No technical jargon (or explained simply if unavoidable)
- [ ] No "impressive" AI outputs (relatable examples only)
- [ ] No comparison or ranking of students
- [ ] Celebrates thinking, not speed/accuracy
- [ ] Frames AI as responding to thinking, not intelligence
- [ ] Brand voice: Revolutionary Hope (hope + empowerment, no fear)
- [ ] Language altitude appropriate for zone

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Concrete experience, not abstract concept
- [ ] Relatable examples, not intimidating ones
- [ ] Storytelling hooks or personal anecdotes
- [ ] Two-host conversational format
- [ ] Connects to previous zone's nodes (lattice accumulation)

### CIS Alignment Check (All Nodes)
- [ ] Node Habit reinforcement matches corresponding CIS agent prompt
  - Habit 1 nodes → /frame agent (Epic 4, Story 4.2)
  - Habit 2 nodes → /frame agent with context focus (Epic 4, Story 4.2)
  - Habit 3 nodes → /diverge + /challenge agents (Epic 4, Stories 4.3-4.4)
  - Habit 4 nodes → All agents including /synthesize (Epic 4, Story 4.5)
- [ ] Examples in node are consistent with what CIS agents will say
- [ ] Habit language matches between node and agent prompts
- [ ] Cross-reference documented: Epic 4 Story X.Y for CIS agent specification
- [ ] No contradictions between node teaching and agent scaffolding

**Purpose:** Prevents "node says one thing, agent says another" confusion. Students should hear consistent messages across all touchpoints.

**FAIL any of these?** → Node needs revision before zone-specific review.

- [ ] Students likely to use habit more after node?
- [ ] Habit connection is explicit, not subtle
- [ ] Uses branded habit language from Epic 1.4 (4 Habits Branding):
  - Habit 1: "Pause Before Asking" ⏸️ - tagline: "Know what you want before you ask"
  - Habit 2: "Explain Context First" 🎯 - tagline: "Give AI the situation, not just the question"
  - Habit 3: "Change One Thing at a Time" 🔄 - tagline: "What does this affect?"
  - Habit 4: "Use AI Before Decisions" 🧠 - tagline: "Help me think, not just answer"
- [ ] Positions habit as **graduation-proof skill** (not just cohort technique)
- [ ] Reinforces that "keeping these habits = success" (from Epic 1.4)
- [ ] Cross-reference: Epic 1, Story 1.4 for complete 4 Habits branding

**Purpose:** Connects habits to the graduation artifact students will earn. Nodes reinforce that these are durable skills worth demonstrating to parents/future.

### Zone Progression Check (All Nodes)
- [ ] Connects to previous zone's nodes (lattice accumulation)
- [ ] Builds on earlier habits (Habit 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- [ ] Identity shift is clear and specific
- [ ] Prepares for next zone's shift

## Emotional Resonance Preview Testing

**Purpose:** Validate emotional claims before full deployment. Since we can't test with full student panels before Cohort 1, use rapid preview testing for high-risk nodes.

### When to Use Preview Testing

**REQUIRED for:**
- All Week 1 nodes (Zone 0→1 - sets first impression)
- Any node with new/emotional territory (first time addressing anxiety, belonging, ownership)
- Nodes where Trevor is uncertain about emotional impact

**OPTIONAL for:**
- Nodes in later weeks that follow proven patterns
- Minor iterations of existing nodes

### Preview Test Protocol

**Step 1: Assemble Preview Panel**
- Recruit 3-5 students from target demographic (pre-university, similar to cohort)
- Diverse representation (gender, background, AI exposure)
- Compensate their time (small stipend or gift card)

**Step 2: Prepare Test Materials**
- Share **transcript** (not full podcast - faster review)
- Include context: "This is a draft for an AI learning program"
- Provide emotional target: "After reading, you should feel [emotion]"

**Step 3: Collect Feedback (24-hour turnaround)**
Ask each panelist:
1. **Emotion Check**: "After reading this, I feel..." (rate 1-5 on target emotion)
2. **Relatability**: "Could this be about me?" (yes/no/unsure)
3. **Confusion**: "What was confusing or unclear?" (open text)
4. **Connection**: "What resonated most with you?" (open text)

**Step 4: Analyze Results**

**PASS Threshold:**
- 80%+ rate target emotion 4/5 or higher
- 0% report confusion about core message
- 2+ panelists volunteer specific "that's me" moments

**FAIL Indicators:**
- <60% rate target emotion 4/5 or higher
- 2+ panelists report confusion
- 0 panelists report relatable moments

**Step 5: Decision Protocol**

**PASS → Deploy** (with any MINOR improvements noted)
**MIXED → Trevor decides** (use judgment on whether issues are MAJOR or MINOR)
**FAIL → Revise** (address emotional resonance issues, re-test if needed)

### Example Preview Test Results

**Node 0.4 "It's Actually Fun" Preview Test:**

**Panelist 1:** "I feel curious 4/5 - I want to explore careers now"
**Panelist 2:** "I feel relieved 5/5 - I didn't realize AI could help with anxiety about the future"
**Panelist 3:** "I feel confused 2/5 - some examples felt like pressure, not exploration"

**Analysis:** 2/3 hit target emotion (curiosity/engagement), but Panelist 3 found it stressful.
**Decision:** Trevor reviews - decides the stress concern is valid but MINOR (example selection issue). Approves with note to adjust one example.

### Fast-Track Option (When Preview Testing Not Possible)

If preview panel isn't available, use **Trevor + Peer Reviewer Emotional Check**:

1. Both read transcript independently
2. Each rate: "Would this create [target emotion]?" (1-5 confidence)
3. If both rate 4/5 or higher → APPROVE
4. If either rates 3/5 or lower → DISCUSS and REVISE

This is less rigorous than student testing but better than solo judgment.

## Node Production Workflow

### For Content Creators (Epic 3):

**Step 1: Review Zone-Specific Checklist**
- Identify which zone transition this node targets
- Review ALL items in that zone's checklist
- Note any zone-specific prohibitions

**Step 2: Draft Content (NotebookLM Host Guide)**
- Write host dialogue following checklist requirements
- Include 3-5 student stories/examples
- Ensure Habit integration is explicit
- Verify JTBD relevance (Guardrail #11)

**Step 3: Self-Review Against Checklist**
- Check EVERY item in zone-specific checklist
- Mark [x] for passes, [ ] for fails
- Revise until ALL checks pass

**Step 4: Peer Review**
- Another reviewer uses same checklist
- Must pass 100% of checks to proceed
- Document any revisions needed

**Step 5: Trevor Final Approval**
- Trevor reviews with checklist
- Focus on JTBD relevance and emotional resonance
- Approval required for NotebookLM production

### For QA Team (Pre-Deployment):

**Step 1: Verify NotebookLM Output (TRANSCRIPT REVIEW PROTOCOL)**

Since Trevor manually transcribes podcasts, use this structured review process:

**1.1 Transcribe**
- Trevor produces complete transcript of NotebookLM-generated podcast
- Include speaker labels (Host A, Host B) and timestamps
- Save as `.txt` file with naming convention: `node-X.Y-transcript.txt`

**1.2 Markup Transcript**
- Use checklist item numbers in margins: `[1.1]`, `[2.3]`, etc.
- Highlight specific quotes that satisfy each checklist requirement
- For failed items, note WHY and quote the problematic section

**1.3 Evidence Documentation**
For each checklist item, provide:
- ✅ **PASS**: Quote + timestamp (e.g., "2:15 - Host A: 'You've been using AI for years without knowing it'")
- ❌ **FAIL**: Quote + timestamp + specific issue (e.g., "3:45 - Technical term 'LLM' used without explanation")

**1.4 Severity Classification** (see Severity Classification System below)
- Mark each fail as 🔴 CRITICAL, 🟠 MAJOR, or 🟡 MINOR
- CRITICAL fails must block deployment
- MAJOR fails should block deployment
- MINOR fails are noted but don't block

**1.5 Review Summary Template**
```
NODE: X.Y [Node Name]
REVIEWER: [Name]
DATE: [Date]

PASS RATE: [X] / [Total] checklist items ([X]%)

CRITICAL FAILS: [0 or list with timestamps]
MAJOR FAILS: [0 or list with timestamps]
MINOR IMPROVEMENTS: [0 or list with timestamps]

RECOMMENDATION: [APPROVE / REVISE / REJECT]

NOTES: [Any additional observations]
```

**Step 2: Guardrails Compliance Check**
- Run through Universal Pre-Check (all zones)
- Run through Zone-Specific Checklist
- Verify no prohibited content
- Apply severity classification to any failures

**Step 3: Student-Facing Review**
- Would a pre-university student connect with this?
- Is it intimidating or accessible?
- Does it serve their JTBD?
- Test with **Preview Panel** if needed (see Emotional Resonance Preview Testing below)

**Step 4: Deployment Approval**
- Use Severity Classification System (see below)
- 🔴 CRITICAL fails = 0 allowed → Must fix before deployment
- 🟠 MAJOR fails = 0 allowed → Should fix before deployment
- 🟡 MINOR fails = Acceptable → Can deploy with improvements noted
- Document approval in sprint tracker

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Examples Too Impressive
**Symptom:** Student says "I could never do that"
**Fix:** Replace with smaller, relatable examples
**Guardrail:** "No impressive demos" (Epic 1.1)

### Pattern 2: Examples Too Generic
**Symptom:** Could apply to anyone, not pre-university students
**Fix:** Add specific context (age, life stage, JTBD)
**Guardrail:** "JTBD-relevant examples" (Guardrail #11)

### Pattern 3: Examples Too Silly (Guardrail #11 Violation)
**Symptom:** Cat poems, pet names, juvenile games
**Fix:** Replace with career/study/decision examples
**Guardrail:** "JTBD relevance" (Guardrail #11)

### Pattern 4: Emotional Connection Missing
**Symptom:** Informative but not moving
**Fix:** Add storytelling hooks, emotional moments
**Principle:** "Nodes are identity touchpoints, not content chunks"

### Pattern 5: Habit Integration Subtle
**Symptom:** Habit mentioned but not shown
**Fix:** Make habit explicit in host dialogue and examples
**Principle:** "SHOW the habit in action, don't just tell"

### Pattern 6: Language Altitude Wrong
**Symptom:** Too abstract (Level 5) or too simple (Level 0)
**Fix:** Adjust to zone-appropriate altitude (see Brand Framework v3)
**Guardrail:** "Language level appropriate for zone"

## Severity Classification System (Partial Compliance Protocol)

**Purpose:** Prevent endless revision loops while protecting framework integrity. Not all checklist items are equal.

### Three Severity Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL Failures** (Must Fix - Blocks Deployment)
- Guardrail violations (Epic 1.1) - "NEVER" rules broken
- JTBD misalignment - Examples don't serve target audience's jobs
- Brand voice violations - Fear language or hype used
- 4 Habits omitted - Habit not shown in action
- Identity shift missing - No clear "From X to Y" transformation

**🟠 MAJOR Issues** (Should Fix - Should Block Deployment)
- Examples too impressive or intimidating
- Examples too generic (could apply to anyone)
- Emotional resonance weak - Informative but not moving
- Language altitude wrong - Too abstract or too simple
- Habit integration subtle - Mentioned but not demonstrated

**🟡 MINOR Improvements** (Nice to Have - Doesn't Block)
- Could add more storytelling hooks
- Could strengthen connection to previous nodes
- Could vary examples more
- Could make habit more explicit
- Polish and refinement opportunities

### Deployment Rules

**APPROVE for Deployment When:**
- 🔴 0 CRITICAL fails
- 🟠 0-2 MAJOR fails (Trevor discretion if minor)
- 🟡 Any number of MINOR fails acceptable

**REVISE and Re-review When:**
- 🔴 1+ CRITICAL fails
- 🟠 3+ MAJOR fails

**REJECT Completely When:**
- 🔴 3+ CRITICAL fails (fundamental redesign needed)

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

**When Trevor and Peer Reviewer Disagree:**

1. **Discuss the disagreement** - What's the root concern?
2. **Refer to guardrails** - Is there a clear violation?
3. **Apply severity classification** - Is this CRITICAL or MAJOR?
4. **Trevor decides** - As final approval authority, Trevor makes the call
5. **Document the decision** - Note the disagreement and resolution in review summary

**Example Conflict:**
- Peer Reviewer: "Node 0.3 example 'cat joke' is silly and violates Guardrail #11"
- Trevor: "It's intentionally low-stakes and shows Habit 1 in action. This is WONDER zone, it's supposed to be playful."
- Resolution: Trevor approves, documents that 'cat joke' serves the low-stakes permission purpose for Node 0.3

### Partial Pass Documentation

When approving with MINOR improvements noted:

```
NODE: X.Y [Node Name]
STATUS: APPROVED with minor improvements noted

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR NEXT ITERATION:
- [ ] Consider adding another storytelling hook at opening
- [ ] Habit 1 could be more explicit in second example
- [ ] Connection to Node 0.2 could be stronger

DEPLOYMENT: Approved for Cohort 1
NEXT VERSION: Incorporate improvements before Cohort 2
```

This prevents checklist paralysis while maintaining quality standards.

## Success Criteria

**A node is READY when:**
- [x] 0 CRITICAL failures (Severity Classification System)
- [x] 0-2 MAJOR issues (Trevor discretion for borderline cases)
- [x] All Guardrail violations addressed (CRITICAL level)
- [x] JTBD alignment validated (emotional job served)
- [x] Emotional resonance confirmed (through preview or Trevor judgment)
- [x] CIS alignment verified (see CIS Alignment Checks below)
- [x] 4 Habits branding integrated (see 4 Habits Branding below)

**Revised with Severity Classification:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL = 0 allowed (must fix)
- 🟠 MAJOR = 0-2 allowed with Trevor approval
- 🟡 MINOR = unlimited acceptable

This balances quality standards with practical deployment needs.
