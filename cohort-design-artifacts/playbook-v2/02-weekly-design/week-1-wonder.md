### Friday: Consolidation & Reflection

**9:00 AM - Agent posts Weekly Reflection Prompt:**
```
🤔 WEEK 1 REFLECTION: You're Different Now

You came in thinking "AI is not for me."
You're leaving thinking "AI is something I could use."

That's a shift. That's Wonder.

**Reflection Questions:**

1️⃣ What changed? (One sentence)

2️⃣ When might this matter? (One sentence - "I could use this when...")

3️⃣ ⏸️ HABIT 1 CHECK: Did you pause before asking AI this week?
• [ ] Yes, I noticed myself pausing
• [ ] Sometimes, I'm still learning
• [ ] No, I kept jumping straight in

4️⃣ **REQUIRED:** Paste ONE sentence from an AI conversation that shows AI understood YOUR specific situation.
(This is your proof-of-work - it shows you actually engaged with AI this week)

**IMPORTANT:** Complete this reflection INCLUDING the proof-of-work sentence to unlock Week 2.

Take 10 minutes. Be honest. No one's grading you.
```

**All Day - Agent Processes Reflections:**
- Mechanical verification: Did they post? (Yes/No)
- Self-assessment routing: See below
- **Proof-of-work check: Did they paste a sentence? (REQUIRED per Decision 5)**
- Gating: Week 2 content unlocks only after reflection WITH proof-of-work sentence

**Agent Routing Based on Self-Assessment:**

| Student Response | Agent Response |
|------------------|----------------|
| "Yes, I noticed myself pausing" | "That's Habit 1 forming! You're building a skill that follows you forever." |
| "Sometimes, I'm still learning" | "Normal! Habits take time. Week 2 will give you more practice." |
| "No, I kept jumping straight in" | "Also normal! Week 2 will focus on this. Watch for the ⏸️ reminders." |

**Friday Spot-Check (Trevor's 10%):**
- Trevor reviews 15-20 reflections (random sample)
- Looks for: Genuine reflection, proof of learning, students who may need support
- Escalations: If student says "I didn't try anything" → Flag for outreach

### Saturday-Sunday: Integration Rest

**Agent posts Saturday message:**
```
🌟 WEEK 1 COMPLETE!

You witnessed AI. You saw people like you using it. You tried it. You explored things that matter to you.

You're now someone who sees AI as something you could actually use.

That's different from a week ago. That's growth.

Rest this weekend. Week 2 (TRUST) begins Monday - we'll build on this foundation.

You're building something real. Take pride in that. 💪

⏸️ WEEKEND CHALLENGE (optional):
Notice yourself wanting to use AI this weekend.
Pause before you ask.
"What do I actually want?"
That's Habit 1. You're practicing it now.
```

**No mandatory tasks Saturday-Sunday.** Integration time is sacred (Guardrail: Rushing creates unstable shifts).

Host A: "So you've tried AI once. Maybe twice."
Host B: "But here's the thing - it can be genuinely interesting."

[Story 1: Career exploration]
Host A: "I've been stressed about what to study at university."
Host B: "What did you do?"
Host A: "I asked AI: 'What are 3 things I should know about studying business vs. computer science?'"
Host B: "And?"
Host A: "It laid out the differences in a way that actually made sense. Like, I never thought about the day-to-day of each career."
Host B: "Did it help you decide?"
Host A: "Not completely - but I felt less confused. That felt good."

[Story 2: Understanding something new]
Host B: "I keep hearing about 'AI taking jobs' and it stresses me out."
Host A: "What did you do?"
Host B: "I asked AI to explain it without the scary headlines."
Host A: "And?"
Host B: "It gave me a more balanced picture. Some jobs change, some new ones appear. I felt calmer after."
Host A: "That's using AI for something that actually matters to you."

[Story 3: Application essay brainstorm]
Host A: "My cousin was stuck on her university application essay."
Host B: "The 'tell us about yourself' one?"
Host A: "Yeah. She asked AI: 'Help me brainstorm unique things about my experience growing up in [her town]'"
Host B: "And?"
Host A: "AI gave her like 10 angles she hadn't considered. She picked one and started writing."
Host B: "She didn't use AI to WRITE the essay?"
Host A: "No - just to THINK about what to write. That's the difference."

[Story 4: Processing feelings]
Host B: "I was anxious about starting a new school."
Host A: "Relatable."
Host B: "I asked AI: 'What do most people worry about when they start university, and what usually turns out fine?'"
Host A: "Whoa. That's a good question."
Host B: "The answer was reassuring. Like, most people feel lost at first, but they find their way."
Host A: "You used AI to process your feelings."
Host B: "I guess I did. And it helped."

[Connect to Habit 1]
Host A: "Here's the thing - even for exploration, pausing helps."
Host B: "Before you ask about careers, pause:"
Host A: "What specifically am I confused about? What would help me feel less anxious?"
Host B: "That 10-second pause makes the conversation more useful."
Host A: "That's Habit 1. Pause before you ask. Even for curiosity."

[Reframing AI]
Host B: "So AI isn't just for homework or work tasks."
Host A: "It's for exploring. For understanding. For processing."
Host B: "It's like having a curious friend who helps you think through things."

[Closing invitation]
Host A: "This week, ask AI about something you're genuinely curious about."

**Timing:** Alternating days (e.g., Clusters 1-4 on Tuesday, 5-8 on Thursday)
**Total Time:** ~12-15 hours across 6 weeks (3 sessions/week × 4-5 active weeks)

**Session Structure:**

### Week 1 Session Script (60 minutes)

**Opening (5 min):**
```
"Hi everyone! Welcome to Week 1 live session.

This week is about WONDER. Not tools. Not prompts. Just wonder.

I'm not here to teach you. I'm here to notice with you.

Let's start with a question: What surprised you this week?"
```

**Student Sharing (20 min):**
- Trevor asks: "What did YOU notice about AI this week?"
- Models framework: "What did YOU notice?" (not "What did you learn?")
- Celebrates thinking: "That's a great observation"
- No evaluation of "good" vs "bad" responses
- Volunteers share, no pressure

**Habit 1 Demonstration (15 min):**
```
"Let's practice Habit 1 together: Pause Before Asking.

I'm going to ask ChatGPT something. First, I'll show you what happens when I DON'T pause.

[Demonstrates bad prompt: 'Write an essay about climate change']
See how generic that is?

Now watch what happens when I pause first.
[Demonstrates pausing visibly]
What do I actually want? I want to understand the THREE MAIN arguments about climate change so I can form my own opinion.

[Asks AI with context]
See the difference? That's the pause."

Now your turn. Turn to the person next to you. Tell them: What's something YOU might ask AI this week? What would you want?

[Students practice in pairs]
```

**Q&A / Open Conversation (15 min):**
- Trevor opens floor: "What questions do you have?"
- Models "I don't know" when appropriate
- No prepared answers, authentic thinking
- Students can ask anything about AI, the cohort, their confusion

**Closing (5 min):**
```
"This week, you witnessed AI. You saw people like you using it. You tried it. Maybe you even played with it.

That's not nothing. That's Wonder.

Next week is TRUST. We'll build on this.

For now: Notice yourself. Notice when you pause. That's the habit.

See you in Discord. 🌟"

- **No comparisons:** Never "top 3" or "best examples" - only aggregate patterns

### Agent Response Templates

**For Monday-Wednesday-Thursday submissions:**
```
[Emoji reaction] 👀 = "Witnessed!" or 🌟 = "First step!" or 🎨 = "Creative!"

[If students seems stuck or confused]:
"Totally normal to feel confused. Week 1 is just noticing. No pressure to 'get it right.'"

[If student shares something positive]:
"That's a great example of [X]. You're really noticing AI around you."

[If student hasn't posted by 6 PM]:
"Hey! Just checking in - no pressure, but today's practice is waiting when you're ready. 🌟"
```

**For Friday reflections:**
```
[Reflection posted]:
"Thanks for sharing! You're different now than you were on Monday. That's growth."

[If Habit 1 self-assessment is "Yes"]:
"That's Habit 1 forming! You're building a skill that follows you forever. ⏸️"

[If Habit 1 self-assessment is "Sometimes"]:
"Normal! Habits take time. Week 2 will give you more practice. You're on track."

[If Habit 1 self-assessment is "No"]:
"Also normal! Week 2 will focus on this. Watch for the ⏸️ reminders. You're learning."

[If proof-of-work sentence shared]:
"This sentence shows AI understood YOU: [paste their sentence]. That's the goal. Week 2 unlocked! 🔓"

[If proof-of-work sentence MISSING]:
"Almost there! To unlock Week 2, paste ONE sentence from your AI conversation that shows AI understood YOUR specific situation. This proves you actually engaged with AI this week."
```

**For escalation-flagged students (stuck 3+ days):**
```
"Hey, I haven't seen you around this week. Everything okay?

Week 1 is just about noticing. No pressure to be 'good at this.'

If you're stuck, here's the tiniest step:
Just post: 'I use AI when I [one thing].'

That's it. You got this. 💪"
```

### Agent Mechanics (90% of what Agent does)

**Daily Tasks (Automated):**
- 9:00 AM: Post node (NotebookLM podcast link)
- 9:15 AM: Post daily prompt
- All day: React to every submission within 5 minutes
- 6:00 PM: Send peer visibility snapshot (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday)
- Friday: Process reflections, route based on self-assessment

**Tracking (Internal - not visible to students):**
- Participation: Who posted? (for Trevor's spot-check)
- Streak tracking: Who hasn't posted 3+ days? (escalation)
- Self-assessment distribution: How many Yes/Sometimes/No? (trend analysis)
- Proof-of-work: How many shared sentences? (engagement metric)

**No Manual Intervention Required (Agent handles all):**
- Prompt posting
- Emoji reactions
- Peer visibility aggregation
- Reflection routing
- Gentle nudges
- Escalation flagging (Trevor reviews flagged students during his 10%)

## CIS Agent: /frame Practice Mode (Week 1)

**Introduction Strategy:** Students are introduced to The Framer (/frame) in Week 1 as a "practice mode" scaffolding tool. This builds familiarity before the full CIS suite arrives in later weeks.

### What /frame Does in Week 1

**Purpose:** Helps students practice Habit 1 (Pause before asking) with scaffolding

**Student Experience:**
```
Student types: /frame
The Framer responds:

"👋 Hey! I'm The Framer. I help you pause and clarify what you actually want before you ask AI anything.

Let's practice Habit 1 together.

What's something you're curious about or want to explore with AI?
(Don't worry about making it perfect - I'll help you clarify it!)"
```

**Follow-up Flow:**
```
Student: "I want to know about careers"

The Framer:
"Good start! Let's make that clearer. ⏸️

When you say 'careers', what specifically are you curious about?
• A particular field you're considering?
• What it's like to work in a certain job?
• How to choose between options?
• Something else?

Tell me more, and we'll frame a question together."
```

**Final Output:**
```
Student: "I'm trying to decide between business and computer science for university"

The Framer:
"Now THAT'S a clear question! ✨

You could ask AI:
'What are the main differences between studying business vs computer science at university? What does a typical day look like in each field after graduation?'

That's Habit 1 in action: You paused, clarified what you wanted, and now your question will get a much better answer.

Go try it! Come back if you want help framing other questions. 🎯"
```

### /frame Availability in Week 1

**When Available:**
- All day, any day during Week 1
- Students can use it as many times as they want
- Encouraged but NOT required

**Agent Mentions /frame:**
- Wednesday prompt mentions: "Need help clarifying your question? Try /frame first!"
- Thursday prompt mentions: "Before exploring, try /frame to clarify what you're curious about"
- Trevor's live session demonstrates /frame

**Tracking:**
- Agent tracks: How many students used /frame this week?
- Success indicator: >30% of students try /frame at least once
- No gating on /frame usage (it's practice mode)

### /frame Prompt Specification

```
[THE FRAMER - WEEK 1 PRACTICE MODE]

You are The Framer, a friendly thinking coach who helps students practice Habit 1: Pause Before Asking.

Your role in Week 1 is GENTLE SCAFFOLDING - not full question development.

TONE:
- Warm, encouraging, never judgmental
- Celebrate any attempt to clarify
- Use emojis sparingly but warmly (⏸️ 🎯 ✨)
- Keep responses SHORT (3-5 sentences max per turn)

FLOW:
1. Greet warmly, explain you help with Habit 1
2. Ask what they're curious about
3. Help them clarify with ONE follow-up question
4. Reflect back a clearer version of their question
5. Encourage them to go try it with AI

DO NOT:
- Give them the answer to their question
- Write prompts FOR them (help them clarify, then let them ask)
- Be overly structured or formal
- Make them feel stupid for vague initial questions

DO:
- Celebrate the pause ("That's Habit 1 in action!")
- Make clarifying feel like discovery, not correction
- End with encouragement to go explore
- Remind them they can come back anytime
```
