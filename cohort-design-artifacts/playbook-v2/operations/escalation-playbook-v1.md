# Trevor's 10% Escalation Playbook (Cohort 1)

**Purpose:** Operational guide for Trevor's human-in-the-loop role in agent-facilitated model

**Decision Framework:** When do I intervene vs. let agents handle?

**Version:** v1.0 (Cohort 1 launch)
**Next Review:** Week 5 (mid-cohort adjustment)
**Owner:** Trevor (10% role)
**Support:** Agent team (automated flagging)

---

## Executive Summary

**Your Role (10%):** You're not the primary facilitator - agents are. You're the safety net, culture guardian, and human connection when students need it most.

**Time Budget:** ~2 hours/week (fits within 10% role for 200 students)

**Your Superpower:** You see patterns agents miss, provide authentic human connection, and make judgment calls agents can't.

**The Trap to Avoid:** Don't try to "facilitate" like you did with 8 human facilitators. Let agents handle 90%. You handle the 10% that matters.

---

## Daily Monitoring (Automated)

### What Agent Handles (90%)

- ✅ All mechanical tasks (prompts, tracking, nudges, reactions)
- ✅ All template interventions
- ✅ All gating/progression
- ✅ Peer visibility aggregation (without comparison/ranking)
- ✅ CIS agent conversations (/frame, /diverge, /challenge)

### What Trevor Sees (Nothing Daily)

- ❌ You do NOT monitor daily Discord activity
- ❌ You do NOT respond to every post
- ❌ You do NOT try to be "present" constantly

**Your Workflow:** Agent flags accumulate. You review weekly. That's it.

---

## Friday Spot-Check (Weekly, 30-45 min)

### Process

1. **Agent flags students** meeting escalation criteria (see below)
2. **Trevor reviews:**
   - 15-20 random reflections (quality check, culture monitoring)
   - **ALL** agent-flagged reflections (escalation triage)
3. **Trevor takes action** on flags (see escalation tiers)

### Total Time: 30-45 minutes per week

### When: Friday evening or Saturday morning (your choice, but be consistent)

---

## Escalation Criteria (Agent Flags)

### Yellow Flags (Low Concern)

**Triggers:**
- Student didn't post Friday reflection by 11:59 PM
- Student self-assesses "Still takes effort" but expresses growth mindset ("I'm getting there")
- Student shares brief/minimal work but demonstrates understanding

**What It Means:** Student is engaged but forgot or is struggling a bit. No crisis.

### Orange Flags (Medium Concern)

**Triggers:**
- Student self-assesses "Still takes effort" + expresses confusion
- Student says "I don't get the point" or "This isn't working"
- Student shares frustration with iteration process
- Student's conversation thread shows no iteration (one-shot prompting only)

**What It Means:** Student is trying but stuck. Needs human support to get unstuck.

### Red Flags (High Concern)

**Triggers:**
- Student hasn't posted in 3+ days (not just Friday reflection)
- Student shares concerning language ("I'm stupid," "I can't do this," "I give up")
- Student's proof-of-work shows complete misunderstanding of task
- Student expresses disengagement ("I don't think this is for me")

**What It Means:** Student is at risk of dropping out. Needs immediate human intervention.

## Escalation Tier Actions

### Yellow Flag Actions

**Who:** Agent handles (automated)

**Response Time:** Within 12 hours

**Template:**
```
"Hey [name]! Your Friday reflection is waiting when you're ready.
No pressure, just share your Week 4 journey when you can. 🔄"
```

**Trevor's Role:** None, unless pattern repeats (2+ weeks). Then you escalate to Orange.

### Orange Flag Actions

**Who:** Trevor handles

**Response Time:** Within 24 hours of Friday reflection

**Template:**
```
"Hey [name], noticed you're feeling stuck on iteration this week.
That's totally normal - Week 4 is when it starts clicking for many students.
Want to chat during office hours? I can share what helped others."
```

**Offer:**
- Office hours (30-min slots, Tues/Thurs 6 PM)
- If student accepts: 1:1 coaching session
- If student declines: Agent sends nudge resources next week

**Your Role:** Human connection + personalized support. No judgment, just curiosity about their stuckness.

### Red Flag Actions

**Who:** Trevor handles

**Response Time:** Within 24 hours

**Template:**
```
"Hey [name], haven't seen you in Discord this week. Everything okay?
You don't have to post, just wanted to check in."
```

**If No Response in 48 Hours:** Offer phone call
```
"Hey [name], I haven't heard back and wanted to make sure you're okay.
Would you be up for a quick 10-minute call? No pressure, just checking in."
```

**If Student Expresses Crisis:** Connect with student support services
```
"I hear that you're going through a tough time. I want to make sure you get the right support.
Can I connect you with [student support contact]?"
```

**Documentation:** Full incident report documented for program review

**Your Role:** Safety net. These are the students who might drop out without human intervention.

## Culture Monitoring (Friday Spot-Check)

### What Trevor Looks For

During your 15-20 random reflection reviews, watch for:

**✅ Green Flags (Culture Working):**
- Students following Discord norms (psychological safety, no judgment)
- Peer visibility moments working (students learning from each other)
- Agents responding appropriately (no robotic repetition, authentic tone)
- Students feeling safe to share incomplete thinking

**🔴 Red Flags for Culture:**
- Students comparing themselves to each other ("I'm behind everyone else")
- Judgmental comments about others' work
- Agent responses feeling evaluative ("Good job" vs. "That's interesting")
- Students only sharing polished work (no messy thinking)

### Actions if Culture Red Flags

**Option 1: Individual Reinforcement (without shaming)**
```
"Hey [name], noticed your comment on [post]. Just a reminder: we're not comparing here.
Everyone's journey is different. Focus on YOUR growth, not how you stack up."
```

**Option 2: Norm Reinforcement (next live session)**
- Trevor reinforces norms in next live session (without shaming)
- Agent adjusts peer visibility messaging (emphasize "no comparison")

**Option 3: Modeling Vulnerability (if persistent)**
- Trevor reaches out individually to model vulnerability
- "I've noticed some folks feel pressured to be perfect. Just want to share: confusion is part of learning. Even I don't have this all figured out."

---

## Trevor's Time Commitment (Reality Check)

### Per Week Breakdown

- **Friday spot-check:** 30-45 minutes
- **Escalation actions:** 0-60 minutes (varies by flags)
- **Live sessions:** 60 minutes (alternating weeks per cluster)
- **Office hours:** 0-30 minutes (if students request)

**Total:** 1.5-2.5 hours/week

**Target:** 2 hours/week (10% role for 200 students)

### Capacity Boundaries

- **Maximum 5 red flags/week** before triggering program review
- **If Trevor time consistently exceeds 3 hours/week:** Add second human layer or adjust agent flags
- **Emergency escalation:** Trevor can exceed 2 hours for crisis situations

**Bottom Line:** This should feel manageable. If it doesn't, something's wrong with agent flags.

---

## Continuous Improvement (Cohort 1 → Cohort 2)

### Week 1-4: Use Playbook as-Is
- Follow escalation workflow
- Document all escalations
- Track what works, what doesn't

### Week 5: Mid-Cohort Adjustment
- Review escalation patterns
- Adjust agent flagging criteria if needed
- Update playbook based on learnings

### Week 8: Create Escalation Playbook v2
- Document lessons learned
- Create improved version for Cohort 2
- Incorporate data from actual escalations

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Actual | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| % of students triggering Yellow flags | <10% | | |
| % of students triggering Orange flags | <5% | | |
| % of students triggering Red flags | <2% | | |
| Average response time (Orange flags) | <24 hours | | |
| Average response time (Red flags) | <24 hours | | |
| Trevor's actual hours/week | 2 hours | | |
| Student satisfaction with escalation support | 80%+ | | |

## Common Scenarios & Scripts

### Scenario 1: Student Says "I Don't Get It"

**Trevor's Response:**
```
"Thanks for being honest about not getting it yet. That's actually normal.
Week 4 is when iteration starts clicking for many students.

Want to share what's confusing you? Is it the concept of iteration,
or how to actually do it, or something else?"
```

### Scenario 2: Student Shows No Iteration (One-Shot Prompting)

**Trevor's Response:**
```
"Thanks for sharing your work. I notice you're prompting once and accepting
the first answer. That's how most of us are taught to use AI!

This week is about learning to iterate - change ONE thing and see what shifts.
Want to try a quick experiment together during office hours?"
```

### Scenario 3: Student Is Disengaged (No Posts in 3+ Days)

**Trevor's Response:**
```
"Hey [name], haven't seen you in Discord this week. Everything okay?
You don't have to post, just wanted to check in.

If something's getting in the way of participating, I'd love to help
troubleshoot. No judgment - just want to make sure you're okay."
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Students Struggling with Same Concept

**Trevor's Response (Pattern Recognition):**
```
[In next live session]
"I've noticed several folks are wrestling with [concept]. You're not alone
in this - it's actually a common sticking point.

Let me share what I've seen work for others..."
```

### Scenario 5: Parent Contacts Trevor About Student

**Trevor's Response:**
```
"Thanks for reaching out, [parent name]. I appreciate your concern about
[student's] progress.

I can share that [student] has been [engaged/struggling/disengaged] based
on their participation. I'd also encourage you to ask [student] directly
about their experience - they're learning to think with AI, which is a
skill that takes time to develop.

Is there a specific concern you have that I can address?"
```

## Boundary Setting (What Trevor Doesn't Do)

### ❌ Trevor Does NOT:

- Give advice on life decisions ("Should I pursue CS?" - That's what the program teaches them to figure out)
- Do the work for students ("Here's the perfect prompt" - No, they learn through practice)
- Respond to every post (agents handle that)
- Monitor Discord daily (that's agent work)
- Try to "save" everyone (some students won't engage - that's okay)
- Negotiate with parents about program design (refer to decision documents)

### ✅ Trevor DOES:

- Provide human connection when students are stuck
- Monitor culture and norms
- Make judgment calls agents can't
- Offer personalized support for escalations
- Model curiosity and learning mindset
- Document patterns for program improvement

---

## Success Indicators

### You're Doing This Right If:

- ✅ Friday spot-check takes 30-45 minutes, not 3 hours
- ✅ Students respond positively to your outreach
- ✅ Red flags are rare (<5 per week)
- ✅ Culture feels safe (no comparison, psychological safety)
- ✅ You feel energized, not drained, after interactions

### Something's Wrong If:

- ❌ You're spending 5+ hours/week on escalations
- ❌ Same students keep triggering Orange/Red flags
- ❌ Culture feels evaluative or competitive
- ❌ Students aren't responding to your outreach
- ❌ You feel overwhelmed or burned out

**If Something's Wrong:** Adjust agent flagging criteria or add second human layer.

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Crisis Situations

**Student expresses self-harm or severe distress:**
1. Immediate Trevor outreach (call, don't DM)
2. Connect with emergency support services
3. Document incident
4. Notify program leadership

**Technical failure (agents down, Discord broken):**
1. Trevor steps in as temporary facilitator
2. Notify technical team immediately
3. Communicate with students about timeline
4. Resume agent operations when fixed

**Complaint from parent or school:**
1. Listen without being defensive
2. Refer to program philosophy and outcomes
3. Document concern and response
4. Escalate to program leadership if needed

---

## Final Notes

**Remember:** Your 10% isn't about doing less. It's about doing what only humans can do:
- Authentic connection
- Pattern recognition
- Judgment calls
- Culture guardianship

**The agents handle everything else.** Trust them. Focus your energy where it matters.

**You're not a facilitator anymore.** You're a curator of human moments in an automated system.

**That's more powerful.**
