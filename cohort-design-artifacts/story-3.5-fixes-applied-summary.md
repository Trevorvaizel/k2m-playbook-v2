## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix #1: Corrected Identity Shift Language (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Document used "AI helps me do things" → "I direct AI to create what I want"

**Fix Applied:** Updated to use Epic 1.3's zone-level theme:
- **From:** "AI collaborates with me"
- **To:** "I direct AI with intention"
- **Zone Theme:** "From collaborator to director"

**Locations Updated:**
- Line 39: Master prompt description
- Lines 126-132: Identity shift section with all 4 node-specific shifts

**Evidence:**
```
IDENTITY SHIFT YOU'RE CREATING:
**Zone-level theme (from Epic 1.3):** From collaborator to director
**Each node targets a specific shift:**
- Node 3.1: "AI's output is final" → "AI's output is starting point"
- Node 3.2: "AI decides quality" → "I decide quality"
- Node 3.3: "I hope AI understands" → "I know how to direct AI"
- Node 3.4: "AI created this" → "I made this (with AI's help)"
```

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Corrected Emotional Job Language (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Document used generic "Ownership" category instead of specific emotional job

**Fix Applied:** Explicitly stated the emotional job as "I have opinions about quality" (Ownership)

**Locations Updated:**
- Line 42: Main prompt description
- Lines 209-210: Node 3.2 emotional job section (NEW)

**Evidence:**
```
YOUR PODCAST'S JOB:
Help them move from "I use AI to help me" to "I decide quality, I steer AI, I own the output."
Create the feeling: "I have opinions about quality" (Ownership), not dependency.
```

```
**EMOTIONAL JOB (from Epic 1.2):**
This node targets the emotional job: "I have opinions about quality" (Ownership).
Create the feeling that students have developed taste and standards.
```

### ✅ Fix #3: Added Comprehensive Pre-Upload Checklist (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Missing Trevor workflow section - no clear guidance on preparing sources

**Fix Applied:** Added complete 117-line pre-upload checklist section with:
- 7 source documents with exact file paths
- Line numbers for each document
- Verification checkpoints
- Upload preparation options
- Pre-flight check
- Estimated timeline (20-25 minutes)
- Troubleshooting guide

**Locations Added:**
- Lines 374-488: Complete new section "Trevor's Pre-Upload Checklist"

**Evidence:**
```
## Trevor's Pre-Upload Checklist

**Before opening NotebookLM, gather these files:**

### Source Document Verification

**[ ] 1. Cartographer's Manifesto - Zone 3→4 sections**
- **File Path:** `docs/cartographers_manifesto/`
- **Check:** Does it explain Zone 3 (collaborator) and Zone 4 (director)?
- **Estimated Search Time:** 3 minutes

[... continues for all 7 documents ...]
```

**Impact:** Trevor can now immediately begin source preparation without guessing or searching.

### ✅ Fix #4: Clarified Dual Pillars Mapping (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** Habit 4 Dual Pillars connection was confusing - suggested Habit 4 demonstrates Democratized Intelligence

**Fix Applied:** Clarified that Habit 4 is officially Pillar 2, but directorship involves both pillars

**Locations Updated:**
- Lines 44-49: Master prompt Dual Pillars section
- Lines 166-168: Node 3.1 Dual Pillars connection
- Lines 212-214: Node 3.2 Dual Pillars connection
- Lines 256-258: Node 3.3 Dual Pillars connection
- Lines 300-302: Node 3.4 Dual Pillars connection

**Evidence:**
```
**THE DUAL PILLARS FRAMEWORK (Critical):**
Students are engaging with BOTH pillars this week. Habit 4 is officially part of
Democratized Expertise (Pillar 2), but directorship involves clearer judgment (Pillar 1)
AND better knowledge access (Pillar 2).

While Habit 4 is officially part of Pillar 2 (Expertise), directorship naturally involves
both pillars. When students "decide with AI," they're accessing knowledge (Pillar 2) AND
thinking clearly (Pillar 1). That's the unifying skill: Thinking WITH AI.
```

**Node-specific clarifications:**
- Node 3.1: "primarily uses Democratized Expertise (accessing knowledge) while developing judgment (Pillar 1)"
- Node 3.2: "develops Democratized Intelligence (Pillar 1) - building judgment"
- Node 3.3: "both pillars working together: accessing better knowledge (Pillar 2) AND developing better thinking (Pillar 1)"
- Node 3.4: "brings both pillars together as directorship"

---

### ✅ Fix #5: Strengthened Rock Climbing Metaphor (LOW)

**Issue:** Metaphor was present but could explicitly name the 4 holds

**Fix Applied:** Added specific hold names to strengthen mental lattice imagery

**Locations Updated:**
- Lines 69-73: Master prompt with 4 hold names
- Line 171: Node 3.1 - "first hold"
- Line 217: Node 3.2 - "second hold"
- Line 261: Node 3.3 - "third hold"
- Line 305: Node 3.4 - "fourth and final hold"

**Evidence:**
```
The 4 holds you're grabbing this week:
1. "First draft is raw material" hold
2. "I have opinions about quality" hold
3. "Direction techniques work" hold
4. "I made this" hold (final hold - you've reached Zone 4, the summit!)
```

```
**NODE ARCHITECTURE:**
"This is the first/second/third/fourth hold you're grabbing this week: [node name].
You're climbing higher, adding this node to your mental lattice."
```
