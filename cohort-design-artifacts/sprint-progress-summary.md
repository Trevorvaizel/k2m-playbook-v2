   - Deployment rules: 0 CRITICAL, 0-2 MAJOR acceptable
   - Conflict resolution when Trevor and peer reviewer disagree
   - Partial pass documentation template

4. ✅ **Emotional Resonance Preview Testing** (student panel validation)

### Decision Timeline Update (2026-01-23)
**Decision 11 Update:** CIS Agent Graduated Introduction
- **Original:** Full CIS suite introduced Week 4

- **Rationale:** Early scaffolding of Habit 1 and Habit 2, reduces facilitator burden from Week 1

### 8-Week Timeline Decision (Locked 2026-01-23)
**Decision:** Extended from 6 to 8 weeks
- **Rationale:** JTBD emotional job ("stop feeling anxious") requires adequate dwell time for identity shifts to stabilize
- **Impact:** Epic 2 stories restructured from 6 individual weeks to 4 two-week blocks
- **Zone Distribution:** Wonder (1 week), Trust (2 weeks), Converse (2 weeks), Direct (2 weeks), Consolidation (1 week)

### Guardrail #11 Addition (2026-01-23)
**New Guardrail:** JTBD-Relevant Examples
- **Requirement:** All node examples must be relevant to pre-university life transition
- **Approved:** Career exploration, study decisions, applications, understanding complex topics
