**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive 11-guardrail compliance checklist for Story 6.1
- Each guardrail now has explicit evidence of compliance
- Coverage: 100% (was 36%, now 100%)

**Impact:** Epic 1.1 foundation requirement met - all guardrails enforced throughout artifact system.

---

#### H2: Decision 17 Dual-Pillar Brand Integration
**Issue:** Decision 17 (Dual-Pillar Brand Foundation: Democratized Intelligence + Expertise) completely missing from Epic 6.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1 Section 6 Template:** Redesigned with Dual-Pillar narrative
  - "Now I can: Access expertise I don't have + Think clearly with that expertise"
  - Lead with Pillar 2 (Expertise Access) as Victor recommended for JTBD Emotional Job alignment
- **Story 6.5 Parent Report:** Added Dual-Pillar translation
  - "The Two Capabilities They Gained: 1. Access to Expertise, 2. Clear Thinking"
- **Story 6.6 Graduation Card:** Updated tagline
  - "I can access expert knowledge I don't have—and think clearly with it"
- **Quality Dimensions:** Integrated Dual-Pillar framework across all 5 dimensions

**Impact:** Complete brand positioning now communicates BOTH capabilities (Intelligence + Expertise), directly addressing JTBD Emotional Job ("I felt behind, like I didn't know enough").

---

#### H3: JTBD Emotional Job Integration
**Issue:** Epic 6 focused on Social Job (proof) and Functional Job (clarity) but IGNORED Emotional Job (anxiety→belonging).
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1 Section 6 Template:** Added emotional journey prompts
  - "Before K2M, I felt..." (anxiety, feeling behind)
  - "What changed for me:" (anxiety→confidence, outsider→belonging)
- **Story 6.3 Quality Dimension #4:** Renamed to "Before/After Clarity (Epic 1.2 JTBD Emotional Job)"
  - Strong criteria now includes: "I used to feel X (anxious, behind). Now I feel Y (confident, belonging)."
- **Story 6.5 Parent Report:** Added emotional transformation section
  - "Before: They felt anxious, behind... After: They feel confident, like they belong"
- **Story 6.6 Graduation Card:** (Emotional confidence implicit in ownership language)

**Impact:** All three JTBD jobs now addressed (Functional + Emotional + Social), with Emotional Job woven throughout stakeholder views.

---

#### H4: Epic 1.3 Node Architecture References
**Issue:** Epic 6 artifact is PRIMARY Zone 3→4 deliverable, yet no explicit Node 3.1-3.4 mapping.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1 Section 6 Guidance:** Added Node Architecture Integration section
  - Node 3.1 "First draft is raw material" → Visible in Section 4 (challenging process)
  - Node 3.2 "I have opinions about quality" → Visible in Section 5 (synthesis ownership)
  - Node 3.3 "Direction techniques work" → Visible in all 4 CIS agent uses
  - Node 3.4 "I made this" → Visible in Section 6 (ownership language)
- **Story 6.3 Quality Dimension #5:** Named "Zone Shift Evidence (Epic 1.3 Node 3.4)"
  - Measures director ownership language vs collaborator language
- **Quality Check:** Updated example artifact to demonstrate all 4 nodes

**Impact:** Epic 1.3 foundation now fully integrated - artifact design explicitly maps to Zone 3→4 transformation nodes.

---

#### H5: Acceptance Criteria NOT Defined for ANY Story
**Issue:** Zero acceptance criteria for any of the 6 stories - no measurable completion criteria.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (Foundation integration, Decision alignment, Cross-story integration, Technical completeness, Stakeholder needs, Brand voice, Quality framework, Implementation-ready)
- **Story 6.2:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (same structure)
- **Story 6.3:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (same structure)
- **Story 6.4:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (same structure)
- **Story 6.5:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (same structure)
- **Story 6.6:** 8 Acceptance Criteria (same structure)

**Total:** 48 Acceptance Criteria (8 per story × 6 stories)

**Impact:** All stories now have clear, measurable completion criteria aligned with Epic 1 foundations, Decisions 11-14+17, and cross-story integrations.

---

#### H6: Technical Implementation Specs Incomplete
**Issue:** Epic 6 provided "what" (content, format, structure) but NOT "how" (technical implementation).
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1:** Added Technical Implementation Notes (Discord bot rendering, state management, CIS integration, validation logic)
- **Story 6.2:** Added Technical Implementation Notes (privacy storage, automatic posting triggers, peer reaction tracking)
- **Story 6.3:** (Metrics framework - no additional technical specs needed)
- **Story 6.4:** Added Technical Implementation Notes (verification automation, false positive detection algorithms)
- **Story 6.5:** Added Technical Implementation Notes (PDF generation library, email delivery API, template rendering engine, parent database schema)
- **Story 6.6:** Added Technical Implementation Notes (QR code generation, verification page hosting, digital badge formats)

**Impact:** All stories now have clear technical specifications for development teams - rendering approaches, database schemas, API dependencies, integration points.

---

#### H7: Parent Email Delivery System Undefined
**Issue:** Story 6.5 designed parent report but provided ZERO specification for email delivery infrastructure.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.5 Email Delivery Specifications:** Added complete section
  - Infrastructure: Uses Story 5.3 SendGrid integration
  - Timing: Friday Week 8 after artifact completion
  - Trigger: Automatic if parent email exists + consent given
  - Privacy Handling: If student chose "Private," report still sent with privacy note
  - Template: HTML email with PDF attachment
  - Error Handling: Retry logic, bounce tracking, failure escalation
- **Cross-Reference:** Added explicit references to Story 5.3 lines 95-145 (email infrastructure)

**Impact:** Complete email delivery system specified with Story 5.3 integration, privacy controls, and error handling.

---

#### H8: Credential Verification System Under-Specified
**Issue:** Story 6.6 mentioned verification but provided minimal specification. Marked "optional" but listed in value proposition.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Decision:** Implement Path A (lightweight verification) for credibility
- **Story 6.6 Verification System Specification:** Added complete section
  - Database: Single Google Sheet (reuse Story 5.5 infrastructure)
  - Schema: `credential_id`, `student_name`, `graduation_date`, `artifact_submitted`
  - QR Code: Generated on card, encodes `k2m-edtech.program/verify?id={credential_id}`
  - Verification Page: Static HTML hosted on K2M website
  - Security: Unique random UUID prevents guessing
  - Implementation: Manual for Cohort 1 (Trevor adds to Sheet), automated for Cohort 2+

**Impact:** Credential now has verifiable credibility (third-party verification) without heavy dev work. Lightweight approach suitable for Cohort 1 manual mode.

---

#### H9: Brand Voice Altitude Inconsistencies
**Issue:** Inconsistent altitude levels (Level 2-3 vs Level 4) mixed throughout Epic 6.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Altitude Framework by Story:**
  - Story 6.1 (Student Template): Level 2-3 (practical, capability-focused)
    - Changed: "I am someone who thinks WITH AI" (Level 4) → "I can access expert knowledge and think clearly with it" (Level 2-3)
  - Story 6.2 (Showcase): Level 2-3 (celebration, peer learning)
  - Story 6.3 (Success Metrics): Level 2-3 (guidance, self-assessment)
  - Story 6.4 (Verification): Level 2-3 (proof-of-work, authenticity)
  - Story 6.5 (Parent Report): Level 2-3 (outcomes, parent-accessible)
    - Changed: "Your child has become someone who thinks WITH AI" (Level 4) → "Your child has developed clear thinking skills with AI as a tool" (Level 2-3)
  - Story 6.6 (Graduation Card): Level 4 (identity-focused, professional)
    - Kept: "I can access expert knowledge I don't have—and think clearly with it" (Level 4 appropriate for credential)
- **Voice Check Prompts:** Added after EVERY section to enforce authentic student voice (Level 2-3)

**Impact:** Consistent altitude throughout all stakeholder views - Level 2-3 for students/parents (practical), Level 4 for credential (identity).

---

#### H10: Missing Story 5.3 Integration
**Issue:** Story 6.5 (Parent Reporting) designed parent report but made ZERO reference to Story 5.3's parent email infrastructure.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.5 Integration with Story 5.3:** Added complete section
  - Parent email addresses sourced from Story 5.4 diagnostic (via Story 5.3 database)
  - Email delivery uses Story 5.3 SendGrid infrastructure
  - Privacy consent verified via Story 5.3 privacy controls
  - If parent opted out of emails, report NOT sent (respect privacy choice)
- **Cross-References:** Added explicit line references to Story 5.3 sections

**Impact:** Story 6.5 now properly integrated with Story 5.3 email infrastructure - no duplicate systems, consistent privacy controls.

---

#### H11: Quality Dimensions Missing "Zone Shift Evidence"
**Issue:** 4 Quality Dimensions measured artifact quality but missed CORE OUTCOME: Zone 3→4 identity transformation.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Added 5th Quality Dimension:** "Zone Shift Evidence / Identity Transformation (Epic 1.3 Node 3.4)"
  - Strong: Director ownership language ("I made this", "I have opinions about quality", "I decided")
  - Developing: Collaborator language ("AI helped me", "ChatGPT showed me")
  - Measures: Zone 3→4 shift from working WITH AI to DIRECTING AI
- **Updated Rubric:** Added Zone Shift Evidence checklist
  - ☐ I use director language not collaborator language
  - ☐ I claim expertise access ("I can access knowledge I don't have")
  - ☐ I demonstrate Zone 3→4 shift (from working WITH AI to DIRECTING AI)
- **Updated All Quality Frameworks:** Integrated 5th dimension across Stories 6.1, 6.3, 6.4

**Impact:** All 5 quality dimensions now measure complete transformation: Depth, Voice, Habits, Emotional Journey, and Identity Shift.

---

#### H12: Missing "Stuck Student" Interventions
**Issue:** Story 6.1 template provided guidance but NO specification for stuck pattern detection and interventions.
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1 Stuck Pattern Interventions:** Added complete section
  - Pattern 1: Can't think of a question → Agent triggers "What decision are you facing?" prompts
  - Pattern 2: Question too small/obvious → Agent suggests "What's the bigger question?"
  - Pattern 3: Exploration feels forced → Agent prompts "What angle haven't you considered?"
  - Pattern 4: Challenging feels harsh → Agent reframes "What assumption feels uncomfortable to question?"
  - Pattern 5: Can't synthesize → Agent asks "If you had to choose one insight, what would it be?"
  - Pattern 6: Reflection feels fake → Agent prompts "What ACTUALLY changed for you?"
- **Integration:** Cross-referenced Story 4.6 lines 673-698 (stuck pattern library)
- **Detection Logic:** 3+ day inactivity on a section triggers intervention

**Impact:** Complete student support system - agents detect stuck patterns and provide scaffolded interventions, reducing Trevor's manual support burden.

---

### MEDIUM-Priority Fixes (8/8 Applied ✅)

#### M1: Example Artifact Lacks Emotional Job Demonstration
**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced example artifact (medicine vs CS) in Appendix to demonstrate:
  - **Before emotional state:** "I felt anxious about university and my future. Everyone else seemed to know things I didn't. I felt behind, like I was faking it."
  - **After emotional state:** "Week 1: I felt like an outsider in AI conversations, anxious I'd be left behind. Week 8: I feel like I belong."
  - **Dual-Pillar demonstration:** "Now I can: Access expertise I don't have + Think clearly with that expertise"

**Impact:** Example artifact now serves as complete model for students - shows Emotional Job journey + Dual-Pillar capabilities + Zone 3→4 shift.

---

#### M2: Parent Report Template Variables Undefined
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.5 Template Variable Specifications:** Added complete section
  - `{section_1_question}`: Automated parent-language translation using Claude API (Level 2-3 altitude conversion)
  - `[specific example from Section 6]`: Manual Trevor selection during Friday spot-check
  - Translation System: Claude API prompts with altitude enforcement, template variable caching, SafetyFilter validation
  - If examples insufficient: Agent prompts student to add parent-friendly examples before publishing

**Impact:** Clear automation specifications for parent report generation - Claude API translation system with manual Trevor oversight for quality.

---

#### M3: Showcase Format Missing "Diverse Thinking" Highlights
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.2 Daily Highlight Selection Criteria:** Added complete section
  - 3 artifacts highlighted per day (Monday-Friday Week 8)
  - Diversity criteria: Different question domains (career, academic, personal, social), different thinking approaches (analytical, creative, values-driven), range of certainty levels (some certain, some uncertain)
  - Highlight format: Pinned message with "🌟 Today's Thinking Diversity 🌟" header
  - No quality judgment - celebrate thinking variety, not output polish

**Impact:** Clear specifications for showcase celebrations - emphasizes thinking diversity over output quality (Guardrail #5 compliance).

---

#### M4: Verification Questions Missing "False Positive" Detection
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.4 False Positive Detection:** Added complete section
  - **CIS Agent Usage Verification:** Cross-reference artifact content with CIS conversation logs (timestamps match? Content aligns?)
  - **AI-Generated Prose Detection:** Flag generic language patterns ("In conclusion", "Therefore", overly polished prose lacking student voice)
  - **Generic Growth Claims:** Flag template responses ("I learned a lot", "AI is helpful" without specifics)
  - Automated detection flags for Trevor's Friday spot-check

**Impact:** Verification system now catches performers vs genuine shifters - protects artifact authenticity (Guardrail #10).

---

#### M5: Success Metrics Missing "Parent Satisfaction" Measurement
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.3 Parent Satisfaction Metrics:** Added complete section
  - 90%+ parents understand what their child learned (post-cohort survey)
  - 85%+ parents report artifact demonstrates clear thinking growth
  - 80%+ parents would recommend K2M based on artifact quality
  - 75%+ parents share artifact with family/friends (social proof)
  - Survey timing: 1 week after parent report delivery

**Impact:** JTBD Social Job now measurable - validates that artifact serves "proof I can show to parents" job.

---

#### M6: Graduation Card Missing "Transferability" Language
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.6 Transferability Tagline:** Added to graduation card
  - "These habits follow you beyond AI—through university, careers, and life."
  - Positioning: Habits are not AI-specific skills, they're transferable thinking skills
  - Epic 1.4 integration: All 4 Habits work beyond AI contexts

**Impact:** Graduation card now communicates long-term value - habits transfer beyond AI tools (supports JTBD Social Job "proof for my future").

---

#### M7: Student Template Missing "Voice Check" Prompts
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.1 Voice Check Prompts:** Added after EVERY section (not just Section 6)
  - After Section 2, 3, 4, 5: "Does this sound like YOU? If it sounds too polished or generic, add more of your honest voice."
  - Before publishing (Section 6): "Final voice check: Would your parents read this and say 'this sounds like [my name]'?"
  - If student answers "No": Agent prompts "What would make this sound more like you? Be honest, even if it's messy."
  - Implementation: Voice check triggers after each section submission

**Impact:** Continuous authenticity enforcement throughout artifact creation - prevents AI-generated prose from accumulating (Guardrail #10).

---

#### M8: Showcase Format Missing "Anonymous" Display Example
**Fix Applied:**
- **Story 6.2 Anonymous Display Format:** Added complete specification
  - Format: `**Thinking Artifact: Anonymous Graduate** 🌟` (generic, no numbers/distinguishers)
  - Timing: All anonymous artifacts posted simultaneously (Friday Week 8 batch) to prevent timing identification
  - Content: Agent checks anonymous artifacts for identifying details before posting (removes personal circumstances that could reveal identity)
  - Privacy protection: Batch posting + content scrubbing prevents peer identification

**Impact:** Anonymous privacy option now truly anonymous - timing and content protections prevent identification.

---

## Party Mode Consensus: Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Bundling Approach (Approved)
**Bundled Fix #1: Foundation Narrative** (H2 + H3 + H11)
- Rationale: All three define core transformation story (Dual-Pillar + Emotional Job + Identity Shift)
- Lead: Maya + Victor (narrative design), John (JTBD alignment)

**Bundled Fix #2: Epic 1 Integration** (H1 + H4)
- Rationale: Both are Epic 1 foundation integrations
- Lead: Winston (foundation compliance), Bob (checklist creation)

**Bundled Fix #3: Cross-Story Technical** (H7 + H10)
- Rationale: Both require Story 5.3 email infrastructure integration
- Lead: Barry (technical specs), Winston (Story 5.3 integration)

**Impact:** 12 HIGH → 8 fix units (more efficient execution, better narrative coherence)

---

### Decision 2: Credential Verification - Path A (Approved)
**Options:**
- Path A: Verified Credential (lightweight verification system)
- Path B: Portfolio Artifact (no verification, zero dev work)

**Decision: Path A - Lightweight Verification**
**Rationale:**
- Barry's spec is minimal (Google Sheet + static HTML page)
- Zero ongoing cost
- Preserves credential credibility (third-party verification)
- Manual for Cohort 1, automated for Cohort 2+

**Implementation:** Google Sheet + QR code + static verification page (4-6 hours dev estimate)

---

### Decision 3: Dual-Pillar Lead - Pillar 2 First (Approved)
**Victor's Recommendation:** Lead with Pillar 2 (Expertise Access), support with Pillar 1 (Thinking Enhancement)

**Rationale:**
- JTBD Emotional Job source: "I felt behind, like I didn't know enough" (knowledge anxiety)
- Pillar 2 directly addresses root anxiety: "You don't need to know everything—you can ACCESS everything"
- Pillar 1 follows naturally: "And you can think clearly with that expertise"

**Applied Throughout:**
- Section 6 template: "The shift happened when I realized... I could access expert knowledge I didn't have"
- Parent report: "1. Access to Expertise, 2. Clear Thinking" (order matters)
- Graduation card: "I can access expert knowledge I don't have—and think clearly with it"
